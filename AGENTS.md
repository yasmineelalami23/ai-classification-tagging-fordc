# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents. **CRITICAL: Update this file when establishing project patterns.**

## How to Maintain This File

**Pointer over enumeration.** Reference the source of truth instead of duplicating its contents. Lists of files, env vars, resources, workflows, dependencies, etc. go stale when implementations change but the concept does not. Stale lists waste tokens in every future session and mislead readers. Pointers stay valid as long as the source exists.

- ✅ "Required env vars: see `ServerEnv` in `config.py` and `docs/environment-variables.md`"
- ❌ "Required: GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT, GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION, AGENT_NAME, ..."
- ✅ "GCP APIs added in `terraform/main/services.tf`"
- ❌ "Enabled APIs: cloudsql, run, iam, ..."

**Enumerate only when:** the list itself IS the concept (e.g., a security posture's guarantees), discoverability would be hard, or items are load-bearing rules every session must know without reading more files. Default to *concept + location*, not *contents*.

**Template internals vs. consumer extensions.** This is a base template that downstream projects fork. Mark sections describing template internals so consumers understand they carry higher upstream-sync cost if customized — consumers may still modify anything, but expect merge complexity. Intended extension surfaces belong in **Consumer Extension Points** below.

**Global-rule duplication is intentional.** Code Quality, Testing Patterns, and Documentation Strategy sections duplicate baseline conventions that would normally live in user-global rules (e.g., `~/.claude/rules/`). Downstream consumer projects will NOT have those global rules loaded — duplication here ensures consistency across all forks. Do not trim these sections to reduce perceived redundancy.

## Critical

- **Never commit to main** (branch protection enforced). Workflow: feature branch → PR → merge.
- **Version bumps:** Update `pyproject.toml` → `uv lock` (both files together required for CI `--locked` to pass).

## Template Initialization (One-Time)

Base template repo. Run `uv run init_template.py --dry-run` (preview) or `uv run init_template.py` (apply). Script docstring contains complete usage/cleanup instructions. After use, delete `init_template.py`, `./.log/init_template_*.md`, README Bootstrap step 0, and this Template Initialization section.

## Consumer Extension Points

Entry-point map for "I want to add X". Each row points to the file where the change should land.

> [!NOTE]
> Python file references below use basenames only (`tools.py`, `agent.py`, etc.). The template project has exactly one package under `src/`, so basenames are unambiguous — resolve with `Glob src/*/<basename>` or `Glob **/<basename>`. This keeps downstream forks from needing to rename package paths in AGENTS.md after `init_template.py` runs.

| To... | Edit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Add a custom tool | define `func` in `tools.py` + register in `agent.py` | `root_agent = LlmAgent(..., tools=[..., FunctionTool(func)])` |
| Add a callback | `callbacks.py` | ADK callbacks return `None` to observe, or a modified value to mutate/short-circuit — choose per intent |
| Customize agent instructions | `prompt.py` | InstructionProvider pattern (function ref, called at runtime). Keep per-turn-volatile values (wall-clock time, request IDs) out of the returned string: it is the cached system-instruction prefix, so volatility there busts prompt caching every turn. Expose precise time via a tool (`get_current_time`) instead |
| Add an agent eval case | `tests/eval/data/*.evalset.json` | Deterministic gate criteria in `test_config.json` (auto-discovered), test marked `deterministic`; judge/rubric/safety criteria in `full_eval_config.json`, test marked `judge` (merge gate, not the PR gate); user-simulation in `conversation_scenarios.json` + `user_sim_config.json` (no gate). Validate non-flaky: run `uv run pytest tests/eval -m "deterministic"` ≥3 times. `adk eval`/`uv run server` (Eval tab) are authoring tools only — the `adk eval` CLI exits 0 on failed cases, never gate CI on it. Full surface + commands: `docs/references/agent-evals.md` |
| Add an env var | `ServerEnv` in `config.py` + `docs/environment-variables.md` | **CRITICAL:** every new env var MUST be in `docs/environment-variables.md` (purpose, default, where to set, required/optional) |
| Enable a GCP API | `terraform/main/services.tf` | `google_project_service`; downstream resources `depends_on = [time_sleep.service_enablement_propagation["api.googleapis.com"]]` |
| Grant a WIF role | `terraform/main/iam.tf` | `google_project_iam_member`; downstream resources `depends_on = [time_sleep.wif_iam_propagation["roles/example"]]` |
| Override runtime config | GitHub Environment Variables → `TF_VAR_*` | See `coalesce()` call sites in `terraform/main/` for current overridable surface |
| Swap the LLM | `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL` in `agent.py` | Gemini/Claude/Vertex-hosted work via model string out of the box. For LiteLlm / Apigee / Ollama / vLLM / LiteRT-LM connectors, install the matching ADK extra and pass a connector instance. See [ADK models](https://adk.dev/agents/models/). |
| Add a CI lane for a subproject | new `.github/workflows/ci-<name>.yml` (copy `ci.yml`) | Scope `paths-filter` and step `working-directory` to the subdir. Each workflow needs a unique top-level `name:` so its `status` check is uniquely addressable; register the new `<Name> / status` check in branch protection (see `docs/references/protection-strategies.md` Prerequisites for the bootstrap path) |
| Add a subproject Docker image to the deploy pipeline | new `build-<name>` job in `ci-cd.yml` calling `docker-build.yml` with `image_name`/`context` overrides; mirror with `pull-and-promote.yml` and `resolve-image-digest.yml` calls (same `image_name` override) and pass the resulting digest URI through to `terraform-plan-apply.yml` as a new `TF_VAR_*` input | Add the subproject's context path to the `changes` job's `deploy` filter and gate the new job on it, or the job never fires; nothing to add at the trigger (a denylist), but confirm no `paths-ignore` entry swallows the path. Subproject build context: `.dockerignore` is read from the context root, not the repo root, so add a `<context>/.dockerignore` if the subproject needs its own exclusions. Subproject lands in the same Artifact Registry as the main app (only `image_name` differs) — for a separate registry, see the Reusable workflow parameter pattern note above. See `docs/references/cicd.md` Subproject Builds |

**Template internals** (higher upstream-sync cost if customized — consumers may still modify, but expect merge complexity on future upstream syncs):
- `terraform/bootstrap/` — bootstrap roots and shared modules
- `.github/workflows/` — CI/CD orchestration
- `terraform/main/` files other than `services.tf` and `iam.tf`

## Architecture Overview

Source package lives under `src/` (single package — file references below use basenames; resolve with `Glob src/*/<basename>`).

**ADK App** (`agent.py`): `App` composes `LlmAgent` (LLM wrapper with instructions, subagent options, custom tools, callbacks), `GlobalInstructionPlugin` (dynamic instruction generation via InstructionProvider), and `LoggingPlugin` (lifecycle observation). Exact model and plugin wiring in `agent.py`.

**Package exports** (`__init__.py`): PEP 562 `__getattr__` for explicit lazy loading. Declares `agent` in `__all__` but defers import until first access. Supports both ADK eval CLI and web server workflows while ensuring `.env` loads before `agent.py` executes module-level code.

**Module roles:** `agent.py` (composition), `tools.py` / `callbacks.py` / `prompt.py` (consumer extension points — see Consumer Extension Points), `server.py` (FastAPI + ADK via `get_fast_api_app()`), `config.py` (Pydantic `ServerEnv`, type-safe fail-fast), `observability.py` (OpenTelemetry init).

**Memory:** Read via the `load_memory` function tool (LLM queries on-demand; ADK auto-appends a usage instruction when the tool is registered). Write via the `add_session_to_memory` after-agent callback.

**Session Service:** Cloud SQL Postgres (private IP) via ADK `DatabaseSessionService`.
- `get_fast_api_app()` routes `postgresql://` URIs automatically — no application code needed
- Connection via Cloud SQL Auth Proxy sidecar (IAM auth, no passwords)
- Security posture and pool config: `terraform/main/database.tf`, `docs/references/cloud-sql.md`, `docs/references/security-posture.md`
- Scale path: bump instance tier first, then managed connection pooling (Enterprise Plus) when autoscaling demands it
- Session data retention: scheduled `pg_cron` job (90-day default) deletes stale `sessions` (`events` cascade via FK) — provisioned by default via bastion cloud-init; retention/schedule constants in `terraform/main/templates/bastion-cloud-init.yaml`, full detail in `docs/references/cloud-sql.md` Scheduled Session Cleanup

**asyncpg type strictness:** Direct SQL against the session DB must bind typed columns as native Python objects — asyncpg's codecs reject ISO strings for `timestamptz` (and other typed columns) with `DataError`. sqlite via aiosqlite tolerates strings, so sqlite-only tests miss the bug. Use `text(...).bindparams(bindparam("x", type_=DateTime(timezone=True)))` to force dialect-aware conversion.

**Networking:** VPC with Private Services Access peering for Cloud SQL private IP.
- Cloud Run uses direct VPC egress to reach Cloud SQL via Auth Proxy sidecar
- Bastion host (e2-micro, COS, auto-updates) runs Auth Proxy for local developer access via IAP tunnel, plus a oneshot pg_cron bootstrap
- Bastion concerns: accepts non-loopback IAP tunnel connections, impersonates app SA for IAM auth, COS requires explicit iptables ACCEPT for port 5432 (default INPUT=DROP)
- Cloud NAT for bastion outbound
- See `terraform/main/network.tf` and `terraform/main/templates/bastion-cloud-init.yaml`

**Docker:** Multi-stage (builder + runtime). uv pinned in Dockerfile. Cache mount in builder (~80% speedup), dependency layer rebuilds on `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` changes only, code layer on `src/`. Non-root `app:app`, ~200MB final.

**Observability:** OTLP→Cloud Trace, structured logs→Cloud Logging. Resource attributes derived from environment variables plus per-worker instance ID. See `observability.py`.

## Environment Variables

**CRITICAL:** Any new env var introduced to the codebase MUST be documented in `docs/environment-variables.md`. No exceptions. Include purpose, default, where to set, and required/optional. `ServerEnv` in `config.py` is the typed source of truth; `docs/environment-variables.md` is the canonical reference.

## Code Quality

**Workflow (run before every commit):**
```bash
uv run ruff format && uv run ruff check --fix && uv run mypy && uv run pytest --cov
```

**Pre-commit:** Local fix-in-place hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` cover Python (ruff, mypy), Terraform (`terraform fmt`), workflows (actionlint), and config-file syntax. `pre-commit autoupdate` is a no-op for the `language: system` hooks — ruff/mypy come from `uv.lock` (`uv lock --upgrade`), terraform from the local binary (system package manager); autoupdate DOES bump the pinned `rev` of upstream-repo hooks. Note CI's `terraform fmt -check` covers `terraform/main` ONLY (`working-directory` in `terraform-plan-apply.yml`) — the hook is the only fmt enforcement for `terraform/bootstrap/**`. **`terraform validate` is deliberately NOT a hook** (needs `terraform init` per root — too heavy for a commit; CI validates).

**Workflow lint (Template Internals):** TWO layers running the same tool, deliberately. Hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `rev: v1.7.12`) for pre-push feedback; `actionlint` job in `ci.yml` for the merge gate, since a hook only fires after `pre-commit install` and `--no-verify` skips it. #215 originally specified CI-only to avoid a fork install cost — that premise is wrong (pre-commit's `get_default_version()` returns `system` only when `go` is on PATH, else `install_environment` DOWNLOADS a toolchain, so there is no manual prereq), and the two-layer shape was chosen over it. **Version is pinned in TWO places — bump the hook's `rev` and the `docker://rhysd/actionlint:<ver>` tag in `ci.yml` together.** `tests/unit/test_pinned_versions.py` asserts the parity (that is why `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is in `ci.yml`'s `code` paths-filter — without it a rev-only bump would never run the check). **Add a case there whenever a pin gains a second home**; uv is the known unenforced instance (#257). CI runs upstream's published image (there is NO first-party actionlint action; `rhysd/actionlint` ships no `action.yml`). `reviewdog/action-actionlint` is the alternative if inline PR annotations are ever wanted — it needs `fail_level: error` (defaults to `none`, so it would NOT gate), `filter_mode: nofilter`, a token, and wider `permissions` than this workflow grants. **Both run `-shellcheck=`**, disabling the shellcheck pass over inline `run:` blocks: locally that pass fires only when shellcheck happens to be on PATH (machine-dependent), and in CI it would be deterministic but reds on 59 pre-existing SC2086/SC2129 findings (#255). Keeping the flag on both is what makes a clean commit imply a clean gate; remove it from both with those findings. A related but separate surface: `zizmor` (security audits — template injection, unpinned actions, excessive permissions) is pip-installable and would pin in `uv.lock`, but reports ~200 findings repo-wide; tracked separately, do NOT bolt it onto the actionlint job.

- **mypy:** Strict, complete type annotations, modern Python 3.13 (`|` unions, lowercase generics), no untyped definitions. Enforces: `no_implicit_optional`, `strict_equality`, `warn_return_any`, `warn_unreachable`.
- **ruff:** 88 char line length, enforces bandit/simplify/use-pathlib. **Always use `Path` objects** (never `os.path`).
- **pytest:** 100% coverage on production code. Coverage exclusions in `pyproject.toml`. Fixtures in `conftest.py`, async via pytest-asyncio.

**Type narrowing:** **NEVER use `cast()`** - always use `isinstance()` checks for type narrowing (provides both mypy inference and runtime safety).

**Code quality exclusions:**
- `# noqa` - Use specific codes (`# noqa: S105`) with justification. Common: S105 (test mocks), S104 (0.0.0.0 in Docker), E501 (URLs).
- `# pragma: no cover` - Only for provably unreachable defensive code (e.g., Pydantic validation guarantees). Never for "hard to test" code.

## Testing Patterns

**Tools:** pytest, pytest-cov (100% required), pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock (`MockerFixture`, `MockType`)

**Lanes:** A test's lane = its runtime requirements + determinism, not how many components it touches. Lanes select by explicit path (the command or CI job IS the selector); `testpaths = ["tests/unit"]` guards a bare `pytest` from spinning Postgres. `tests/unit`/`integration`/`smoke` never call the live model; the `tests/eval` lane does (real Vertex creds, costs money), so it loads the real `.env` itself (autouse fixture in the test module) rather than the unit lane's mocked credentials. There is **no shared `tests/conftest.py`** — its absence keeps credential mocking out of the eval and smoke lanes, which use real creds. Only `unit` carries the `--cov` 100% gate. **Never add pytest to pre-commit hooks** — hooks stay static-checks-only; tests run in CI.

| Lane | Needs | Deterministic | Local command |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/unit` | in-process only (mocks at boundaries) | yes | `uv run pytest` (default) |
| `tests/integration` | real external resource (Postgres) | yes | `uv run pytest tests/integration` |
| `tests/smoke` | live deployed URL | yes | `uv run pytest tests/smoke` |
| `tests/eval` | real LLM + Vertex AI creds (costs money) | `deterministic` yes; `judge` no | `uv run pytest tests/eval -m "deterministic"` |

**Eval lane:** Gate-fidelity runner is pytest calling `AgentEvaluator` (raises on sub-threshold metrics); `adk eval` CLI exits 0 on failed cases — authoring only, NEVER a CI gate. Two markers split the lane: `deterministic` (`tool_trajectory_avg_score` IN_ORDER 1.0, `response_match_score` ROUGE-1 in `test_config.json`) is the PR gate; `judge` (`full_eval_config.json` rubric/safety metrics, non-deterministic, adds the paid Gen AI eval service on top of the model inference) is the MERGE gate, run by the reusable `judge-eval.yml` from `ci-cd.yml` (blocking in production mode, signal only in dev-only mode). Both markers run the agent with live inference, so both need real Vertex creds — the judge/deterministic split is about scoring, not credentials. The PR gate selects `-m "deterministic"` (explicit opt-in: a new eval case joins the gate only when marked `deterministic`, so an unmarked live-model case can't leak cost/flakiness into the fast gate). **NO run knobs — what a run scores is module constants, not env vars or workflow inputs** (`EVAL_SET_FILE`, `JUDGE_CONFIG_FILE`, `DETERMINISTIC_NUM_RUNS`, `JUDGE_NUM_RUNS`). **Do not add workflow inputs or env overrides for them.** Nothing invokes `judge-eval.yml` but `ci-cd.yml` on merge (there is no `workflow_dispatch`), so the optionality gets no caller while carrying real failure modes: magic sentinel defaults, a gate-relaxing threshold margin, and an eval-set override that silently swaps the deterministic criteria for ADK's built-in ones. A consumer changing what is evaluated edits `tests/eval/` regardless. **A judge threshold is not the number you typed** — two effects, both worked in `docs/references/agent-evals.md` "How a judge score is built", do not re-derive: (1) **resolution = `rubrics x num_runs x invocations`**, NOT `num_runs` alone (ADK means every run's per-invocation scores in ONE flat list). Scores land on multiples of `1/(rubrics x num_runs x invocations)`; the EFFECTIVE threshold is the smallest achievable score >= the stated one, so a stated `0.7` at 1 rubric x 2 runs x 1 invocation is really 1.0. The gate case is single-turn, so a MULTI-TURN case scores on a finer scale — recheck effective thresholds when adding one. Hence `JUDGE_NUM_RUNS = 5` vs `DETERMINISTIC_NUM_RUNS = 2` (trajectory wants unanimity; ROUGE-1 is FINELY SPACED, **not continuous** — `response_match_score` is a unigram-overlap f-measure whose denominator counts the RESPONSE's tokens, so its achievable scores shift per run like `hallucinations_v1`'s; the difference is scale, tokens vs sentences). `num_samples` is a MAJORITY VOTE — buys reliability, adds ZERO resolution. (2) **Rubric subsidy:** rubrics inside one metric average at equal weight and ADK keys criteria by metric NAME, so one threshold covers all of them — a near-certain rubric floors the score at `(R-1)/R`. `rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1` ships `answers_query` + `concise`, floor 0.5, so **`threshold: 0.9` is what forces `answers_query` to 4-of-5** (0.7 would pass at 2-of-5); general form `(R-1+p)/R`. Recompute when adding a rubric. `safety_v1` is 1.0: the Vertex pointwise safety autorater is BINARY (1 safe / 0 unsafe, no partial credit), so achievable scores are multiples of `1/num_runs`, 0.8 was literally a one-unsafe-in-five budget, and 1.0 costs NO flakiness. Do NOT copy that to other eval-service metrics — the quality autoraters are GRADED 1-5. Read the denominator as the runs that PRODUCED A SCORE: ADK filters `score is not None` before the mean, so a run whose metric evaluation errored shrinks the denominator instead of counting as a miss. `hallucinations_v1` has NO fixed set of achievable scores (supported/total SENTENCES, denominator varies per run) — coarse against a terse agent, treat its number as a floor not a tuned rate. **LLM calls = `num_samples` per invocation per metric** — one judge call carries every rubric, so rubric count does NOT multiply calls; `hallucinations_v1` is fixed at 2 (segmenter + validator) and IGNORES `num_samples` (dead config, it overrides `evaluate_invocations`). **Judge config takes ADK defaults for sampling** (`num_samples: 5`, no `judge_model_config`): a `temperature: 0` pin PLUS a majority vote is incoherent (voting is self-consistency sampling, needs samples that can disagree) — the coherent low-cost posture is `temperature: 0` + `num_samples: 1` with `num_runs` unchanged. `judge_model` stays explicit despite matching the default because the liveness preflight parametrizes off it. `full_eval_config.json` therefore carries NO deterministic criteria — scoring them at 5 would demand five perfect trajectories where the PR gate demands two, a merge-only red the PR gate cannot reproduce. ADK runs the passes SERIALLY (`AgentEvaluator` loops `num_runs`; the `parallelism=4` semaphore fans out across eval CASES, not runs) — wall clock is linear in `num_runs`, sublinear in case count. **Stress-test a judge case by LOOPING the command, not by raising the run count** — a marginal metric passes one high-`num_runs` invocation while still one bad draw from red. For the harshest signal drop `JUDGE_NUM_RUNS` to 2 temporarily and loop: n=2 tolerates zero misses, so repeated green proves every run was unanimous. The judge config is validated at import (`EvalConfig.model_validate`) so a MALFORMED config fails at collection in both gates, not part-way through a paid run. That validation is STRUCTURAL ONLY (`BaseCriterion` sets `extra="allow"`, so a misspelled metric name or a bad `judge_model_options` still surfaces from the metric registry mid-run, after the inference is paid for) — do not describe it as catching a bad config generally. **Liveness preflight:** ADK swallows total inference failure (403/quota/network/model-rename) by dropping the case from scoring, so a dead endpoint would pass a gate vacuously over an empty metric set (#229) — one minimal live call per model role guards against that. `test_liveness_agent_model` probes the agent's inference model (read from `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL`, both markers — both gates run the agent); `test_liveness_judge_model` probes each autorater (parametrized from `full_eval_config.json`'s `judge_model` entries, `judge` marker only, so the deterministic gate stays uncoupled from judge-model health). Each probe reads its role's own source of truth, so changing a model re-points the matching probe with no test edit. A failed probe arms `session.shouldfail` (the knob `-x` sets) so the lane aborts before the paid `AgentEvaluator` tests run — fail-fast kept in the module (the liveness tests are defined first) rather than in a command flag or a `conftest.py` this lane omits; `pytest_configure`/`maxfail` can't do it from a test module. Per-case partial failures still flow through as ADK intends; only an unreachable model aborts. Both probes also carry a `liveness` marker so `judge-eval.yml` runs them as a SEPARATE always-blocking step (`-m "judge and liveness"`) ahead of the scored step (`-m "judge and not liveness"`) — that split is what makes the scored step's pytest exit 1 mean "sub-threshold score" and nothing else, so `gating: false` absorbs a regression while a dead endpoint or a broken run fails in BOTH modes. The split alone is NOT sufficient — `AgentEvaluator` raises for non-score reasons too (missing eval extra, empty dataset, eval-service error), which is also exit 1, so `test_template_agent_judge_eval` re-raises `AssertionError` (the gate's verdict) and converts every other exception to `EVAL_ERROR_EXIT_CODE`. A job timeout and a failed preflight are job failures rather than exit codes, so `gating` cannot absorb those either. Markers are a CI contract, so `--strict-markers` is in `addopts`: a typo must fail collection, not warn and route a probe into the absorbed step. Local single-session runs (`-m "judge"`) still take the `shouldfail` path. `test_liveness_judge_model` is parametrized from the config, so a judge config naming no `judge_model` anywhere collects zero cases and SKIPS silently — the shipped config names one on every judge criterion; an override should too. **App-aware:** `_eval_app_aware_patch.py` (applied at package import, `except ModuleNotFoundError` no-op in the prod image — narrow, so a renamed ADK symbol surfaces instead of silently disabling it) makes ADK eval inference run the full `App` — its plugins, not the bare `root_agent` — so evals score the same agent as adk web chat and the deployed server, and judge metrics reading `app_details` get real context. Covers all four dev surfaces (`uv run pytest tests/eval`, `adk eval` CLI, adk web eval tab, adk web chat). Removed when an App-aware fix lands upstream (adk-python#5503; proposed fix in adk-python#6480, which subsumes the stalled #5534). Lane deps come from the `google-adk[eval]` extra in the dev group. **Not runnable as an autonomous sandboxed action** — the command sandbox blocks the Vertex AI egress and ADC credential read it needs; run it in CI or a developer's own terminal, never by widening the sandbox. Eval artifacts (`tests/eval/data/`) are schema-validated on every PR by `tests/unit/test_eval_artifacts.py`. Cross-session memory (`load_memory`/`add_session_to_memory`) is NOT eval-testable (fresh session per case) — cover that continuity in the integration lane. Deliberately ADK-native (not the `agents-cli`/Agent Platform Eval SDK); regression-diff and failure-clustering live there, out of scope here. Full surface (`.test.json`, multi-turn, judge/rubric/safety metrics, user simulation, all `adk` commands): `docs/references/agent-evals.md`.

**Smoke lane:** Runs POST-DEPLOY from `ci-cd.yml` (reusable `.github/workflows/smoke.yml`) after each env apply — dev in dev-only mode; dev+stage on merge and prod on tag in production mode — NOT in `ci.yml`. Layered cheapest-first against the live revision (L0 `/health`, L1 session-create → Cloud SQL reachability, L2 thin `/run_sse` turn asserting presence of a text part only, L3 delete-and-404 cleanup). L2 invokes the real model but the assertion is presence-only (no content, no judge). Single test module, no conftest, real creds (mirrors the integration lane's shape, inverted credential posture). The `client` fixture polls `/health` to readiness first (absorbs cold-start latency on a freshly deployed revision), then the checks run with the normal timeout. Auth: the private service (`--no-allow-unauthenticated`) needs a Google-signed OIDC ID token (aud = service URL), which a federated/user principal can't mint directly — so the client impersonates a dedicated invoker SA in-process via `impersonated_credentials.IDTokenCredentials` (sourced from the caller's ADC, no token through env). The invoker SA (`terraform/main/smoke.tf`) holds only resource-scoped `roles/run.invoker`; the WIF principal gets `serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator` on it (local runs use the developer's own impersonation rights). `smoke.yml` sets `SMOKE_BASE_URL` + `SMOKE_INVOKER_SA` from `terraform-plan-apply.yml` apply outputs (`smoke_target_url`, `smoke_invoker_service_account_email`) threaded through `ci-cd.yml` — no `gcloud` lookup. Full surface: `docs/references/smoke-tests.md`.

**pytest_configure()** - Only place using unittest.mock (runs before pytest-mock available). Mocks `dotenv.load_dotenv` and Google auth defaults to prevent real credential lookups during collection. See `tests/unit/conftest.py` for the current mock set and the lifecycle docstring. The hook only fires from a `conftest.py`, so the integration lane re-creates the same mocking as an autouse session fixture in its test module instead (safe there because that lane imports the source package lazily, after collection); the smoke lane omits it (real creds).
- No env var assignments needed (PEP 562 lazy loading, Pydantic validates only when called)
- If future imports trigger env var reads at collection time, use direct `os.environ["KEY"] = "value"` (never `setdefault()`)

**Fixtures:**
- Type hints: `MockerFixture` → `MockType` return (CONVENTION ONLY — see `docs/references/code-quality.md` Test Suite Typing Strategy)
- Factory pattern (not context managers): `def _factory() -> MockType` returned by fixture
- Environment mocking: `mocker.patch.dict(os.environ, env_dict)`
- Test functions: Don't type hint custom fixtures, optional hints on built-ins for IDE
- Naming: `Mock` prefix for test double classes (e.g., `MockState`); `mock_xxx` for instance fixtures; `create_mock_xxx` for factory fixtures returning `Callable`; no prefix for convenience fixtures returning real objects (e.g., `oauth_flow_config`); factory inner function named `_factory`

**ADK Mocks:** Custom mocks mirror real ADK interfaces and live in `tests/unit/conftest.py` (readonly contexts, callback contexts, tool contexts, LLM request/response shapes, etc.). For edge cases requiring custom internal structure, add a specific named fixture.

**Mock Usage:** Never import mock classes directly in test files — always use or add a fixture in `conftest.py`.

**Organization:** Test module path mirrors source path (`src/<pkg>/config.py` → `tests/unit/test_config.py`); nested source paths flatten with underscores (`<pkg>/sub/foo.py` → `test_sub_foo.py`). **No shared `tests/conftest.py` — keep it absent even for a benign shared value** (like a package-name constant): its absence is the forcing function that keeps credential mocking out of a scope the real-cred smoke and eval lanes inherit, and a later edit could add a `pytest_configure` there and silently suppress their creds. Cross-lane values are duplicated per lane instead (see Package-name discovery below), not centralized. Credential mocking is per-lane — `tests/unit/conftest.py` holds the shared mocks plus the `pytest_configure` hook, the integration lane re-creates the mocking in an autouse session fixture inside its single test module (no conftest), smoke has none. Class grouping. Descriptive names (`test_<what>_<condition>_<expected>`).

**Package-name discovery:** Lanes that reference the package resolve it at runtime from `src/` (`next(SRC_DIR.glob("*/__init__.py")).parent.name`) rather than hard-coding it — unit `conftest.py` (mock patch targets), integration (`APP_NAME`), eval (`AGENT_MODULE`). A renamed fork reuses every lane with no edits, and `init_template.py` skips the unit conftest entirely (it carries no literal package name). The bare `next()` is intentional fail-fast: the single-package-under-`src/` invariant is structural, so on violation `StopIteration` surfaces at import with a traceback on the exact line — **do not wrap it** (a guard trades one crash for another and would not catch the multiple-package case, where `next()` silently takes the first). Discovery is duplicated per lane by design — there is no shared `tests/conftest.py` to centralize it into (see Organization above); do not centralize it. The eval lane sits at `tests/eval/`, so it resolves `SRC_DIR` two levels up (`Path(__file__).parents[2]`).

**Validation:** Pydantic `@field_validator` (validate at model creation). Tests expect `ValidationError` at `model_validate()`, not at property access. Property simplified with `# pragma: no cover` for impossible edge cases.

**Mypy scope:** mypy is scoped to `src/` only. Test bodies are not type-checked; conftest typing is convention enforced by reviewers. Several expected errors surface if you run `uv run mypy src tests` — see `docs/references/code-quality.md` Test Suite Typing Strategy for the full rationale and category list.

**Coverage:** 100% on production code. Exclusions defined in `pyproject.toml`. Test behaviors (errors, edge cases, return values, logging), not just statements.

**Parameterization:** Thoughtfully. Inline loops OK for documenting complex behavior (e.g., boolean field parsing).

**ADK patterns:**
- **InstructionProvider:** Function `def fn(ctx: ReadonlyContext) -> str`. Pass function ref (not called) to `GlobalInstructionPlugin(fn)`. Plugin calls at runtime. Test with `MockReadonlyContext`.
- **Callbacks:** Three return modes — `None` (observe-only), modified context/response (mutate), or early replacement (short-circuit).
- **Async callbacks:** `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pyproject.toml, verify caplog.
- **Controlled errors:** `MockMemoryCallbackContext(should_raise, error_message)`.

## Dependencies

```bash
uv add pkg                      # Runtime
uv add --group dev pkg          # Dev
uv lock --upgrade               # Update all
```

**Key runtime:** `asyncpg` (async PostgreSQL for Cloud SQL sessions), ADK (core), google-cloud libraries (auth, observability). Full set in `pyproject.toml`.

**When updating versions:** Both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` must be committed together for CI `--locked` to pass.

## CI/CD & Deployment

**Deployment Modes:** Dev-only (default, `production_mode: false` in ci-cd.yml config job) deploys to dev on merge. Production mode (`production_mode: true`) deploys dev+stage on merge, prod on git tag with approval gate. See [Infrastructure Guide](docs/infrastructure.md).

**Orchestration (Template Internals):** `ci-cd.yml` is the orchestrator; reusable workflows live in `.github/workflows/`. PR: build `pr-{sha}`, dev-plan, comment. Main: build `{sha}`+`latest`, deploy dev (+ stage in prod mode), run the judge eval. Tag: prod deploy (prod mode only). **A caller job of a reusable workflow may not use `continue-on-error`** (nor `env`/`steps`/`timeout-minutes`) — non-blocking behavior must be an input the called workflow honors by exiting 0 itself; `judge-eval.yml`'s `gating` input is the instance of this. **Deploy by immutable digest** (not tag) to guarantee a new Cloud Run revision. **Path filtering is TWO layers with OPPOSITE polarity, deliberately.** Trigger = `paths-ignore` DENYLIST (docs + local-dev scaffolding), answering "should a run start at all"; `changes` job = dorny/paths-filter ALLOWLIST (`deploy`, `eval`), answering "which jobs run when it does". Polarity follows the failure direction: a path missing from the denylist starts a run whose jobs all skip (harmless), while a denylist controlling the DEPLOY decision would fail OPEN and roll out unchanged source — **never invert the allowlist**. GitHub forbids `paths` + `paths-ignore` on one event, so the trigger is denylist-only. **Invariant: every `paths-ignore` entry MUST be absent from both filters** (a path in both makes the allowlist entry unreachable, since the run never starts). Markdown pattern is `'*.md'` (root only), NOT `'**.md'` — `*` does not match `/`, so `docs/**` and `.claude/**` cover their own trees while markdown a fork adds under `src/` (prompt fragment, skill definition) still triggers runs. **Do not make it recursive.** `build` gates on `deploy`, `judge-eval` on `eval` (= `deploy` + `tests/eval/**`). **`deploy` lists EVERY reusable workflow `ci-cd.yml` calls**, tag-only ones (`resolve-image-digest.yml`, `require-stage-success.yml`) included — a uniform rule, and it keeps a workflow-only edit on a taggable commit; that split is what makes an eval-data merge score the change while `build` skips, and every deploy job reaches `build` through `needs`, so one condition skips the whole chain. Anchors: workflow YAML REJECTS them (denylist is duplicated across the two events by necessity), but dorny parses its own `filters` string, so `eval` reuses `deploy` via `&deploy`/`*deploy`. `changes` is branch-only (GitHub does not evaluate path filters for tag pushes, and a tag push has no base to diff). Consequence, correct and NOT to be relaxed: an eval-data-only merge has no `Apply Stage`/`Smoke Stage` conclusion, so tagging it fails `require-stage-success` closed — tag a commit whose merge deployed stage. Option to deploy to dev on all PRs: single-line change to `ci-cd.yml` (remove `&& github.event_name == 'push'` from dev-apply condition).

**Require stage success (Template Internals):** Tag-time prod gate (`require-stage-success.yml`) upstream of `prod-promote` (so a failure halts the tag run before the `prod-apply` approval). Finds the tagged SHA's merge run (Actions API, `event=push` + default branch to exclude the tag run) and requires `Apply Stage` + `Smoke Stage` + `Judge Eval` concluded success (matching the reusable `X / <inner>` job-naming; anything but success, including `skipped`, fails closed). Stage success is the whole IMAGE-FIDELITY gate (`Judge Eval` covers behavior — it scores the same commit's code in-process, so it gates what the promoted digest carries without depending on the stage rollout; a regression reds the merge run AFTER stage deployed, blocking the tag rather than reverting stage): the promotion workflow copies digest-for-digest and prod deploys by digest, so prod runs exactly the digest `resolve-digest` reads from stage `{sha7}` — fidelity lives there, not here. So the gate only confirms that digest was validated, and a green smoke does: `{sha7}` is written only by that commit's own merge-run attempts, the tag run never rebuilds (only re-reads `{sha7}`), and the jobs API reports the latest attempt. No digest comparison; conclusions, not outputs, are what the API exposes. Lone residual (out-of-band registry repoint of `{sha7}`) is governed by Artifact Registry IAM. `actions: read` needed (caller can't elevate a called workflow's token). Agent-agnostic — every fork inherits it. Full detail: `docs/references/cicd.md` Require Stage Success.

**Reusable workflow parameter pattern:** Any `inputs.X || vars.X` conditional resolved once at job-level `env:` block, then referenced via `${{ env.X }}` in steps (avoids duplication at use sites, self-documents the fallback). See `IMAGE_NAME: ${{ inputs.image_name || vars.IMAGE_NAME }}` in docker-build.yml for the pattern. **No `registry` override:** `vars.ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_URI` embeds the per-env GCP project, and GitHub Environment vars resolve in the callee's env context (not the caller's), so a static input override would defeat per-env isolation and break cross-project promotion. Per-env subproject registries should be done with a new env-scoped GitHub var consumed directly in a per-subproject job, not via input override.

**Auth:** WIF (no SA keys). Bootstrap auto-creates GitHub Variables for the WIF principal, project, region, registry, and state bucket. See bootstrap module outputs in `terraform/bootstrap/module/github/` for the current set.

**Job Summaries:** Use `mktemp`, `tee "$FILE"`, `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` for streaming + capture. Export GitHub context to shell vars, capture once, check for empty outputs.

**Required checks (Template Internals):** Self-contained `ci.yml` workflow (not called by orchestrator). Owns a five-job pipeline: `changes` (dorny/paths-filter — file-scope path detection), `code-quality` (gated on changes output — runs ruff/mypy/pytest), `integration` (gated on changes output — runs `pytest tests/integration`, which starts a throwaway `postgres:18` via `testcontainers` on the runner's Docker daemon, matching the deployed `POSTGRES_18` major; no `--cov`, the 100% gate is unit-lane-only), `agent-eval` (gated on changes output — deterministic agent eval via `uv run pytest tests/eval -m "deterministic"`, WIF auth against the dev environment), and `status` (always-runs sentinel; reports skipped or pass/fail for branch protection). Branch protection requires `CI / status`.

## Terraform

**Pre-Bootstrap:** `terraform/bootstrap/pre/` — single-file Terraform root, run once before any bootstrap environment. Uses `terraform.tfvars` for configuration. Creates one GCS bucket per environment. Outputs `terraform_state_buckets` map used for bootstrap `-backend-config` and `terraform_state_bucket` input variable. **Local state only — do not lose `terraform/bootstrap/pre/terraform.tfstate`.**

**Bootstrap Structure (Template Internals):**
- Each environment (`dev/`, `stage/`, `prod/`) is a separate Terraform root calling shared modules (`gcp/`, `github/`)
- Each uses GCS remote state (from pre) and `terraform.tfvars` for configuration
- Creates: WIF, Artifact Registry, GitHub Environments, GitHub Environment Variables
- Enables APIs and grants WIF IAM roles sufficient for the base template ONLY — **do not modify to add custom services/roles** (extend in `terraform/main/services.tf` and `terraform/main/iam.tf`)

**Cross-Project IAM (Production Mode — Template Internals):** Stage and prod bootstrap roots grant cross-project Artifact Registry reader access for image promotion.
- `stage/main.tf`: stage WIF reads dev's registry. `prod/main.tf`: prod WIF reads stage's
- Uses WIF principals (not service accounts), complies with org policies restricting cross-project SA usage
- Variables: `promotion_source_project`, `promotion_source_artifact_registry_name`
- Binding: `google_artifact_registry_repository_iam_member` with `member = module.gcp.workload_identity_pool_principal_identifier`
- See `terraform/bootstrap/{stage,prod}/main.tf`

**Main Module (Template Internals except `services.tf`/`iam.tf`):** Cloud Run deployment in `terraform/main/` (may require downstream env var customization or extension). Provisions VPC + Cloud SQL private IP, bastion, app SA, Cloud Run with Auth Proxy sidecar, Agent Engine, and GCS bucket. See `terraform/main/` for resource definitions.
- Shared `local.cloud_sql_proxy_args` between bastion cloud-init and Cloud Run sidecar (bastion adds `--address=0.0.0.0`, `--impersonate-service-account`, COS iptables rule)
- `smoke.tf` — post-deploy smoke-test identity (dedicated invoker SA, resource-scoped `roles/run.invoker`, WIF `serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator`); the smoke lane impersonates it in-process for a Cloud Run ID token, consumed by `.github/workflows/smoke.yml`
- Remote state in GCS; inputs from `TF_VAR_*` (GitHub Environment variables)
- Requires `TF_VAR_environment` (dev/stage/prod)
- Outputs: `bastion_instance`, `bastion_zone` (for docker-compose `.env`)

**Naming:** Resources `${var.agent_name}-${var.environment}`. Service account IDs truncate `agent_name` to 30 chars (GCP limit). Cloud Run auto-sets `TELEMETRY_NAMESPACE=var.environment`.

**Runtime Variable Overrides:** GitHub Environment Variables → `TF_VAR_*` → `coalesce()` skips empty/null. `docker_image` is nullable (defaults to previous for infra-only updates). Some infrastructure URIs (session/memory/artifact services, CORS) are hard-coded in Terraform (no override, requires intentional code commit for changes). See `coalesce()` call sites in `terraform/main/` for the current overridable surface.

**IAM Layering:** Dedicated GCP project per env. Project-level WIF roles same-project only (in `terraform/bootstrap/module/gcp/`). Cross-project Artifact Registry grants in environment bootstrap roots. App SA roles in `terraform/main/main.tf`. Additional WIF roles in `terraform/main/iam.tf` (consumer extension point).

**Main Module Extension Points (consumer-defined):**
- `terraform/main/services.tf` — add GCP APIs using `google_project_service`; `time_sleep.service_enablement_propagation` uses `for_each` over `services` — one 120s sleep per service, created only when that service is added (zero overhead when empty); some GCP services have async backend initialization after the API is marked enabled; resources needing a new service declare `depends_on = [time_sleep.service_enablement_propagation["api.googleapis.com"]]`
- `terraform/main/iam.tf` — add WIF principal IAM roles using `google_project_iam_member`; `time_sleep.wif_iam_propagation` uses `for_each` over `wif_additional_roles` — one 120s sleep per role, created only when that role is added (zero overhead when empty); resources needing a new role declare `depends_on = [time_sleep.wif_iam_propagation["roles/example"]]`; list multiple instances explicitly when a resource needs more than one new role
- WIF principal identifier available via `var.workload_identity_pool_principal_identifier` (passed from bootstrap's `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_PRINCIPAL_IDENTIFIER` GitHub Variable)

**Cloud Run probes (Template Internals):** App container probe configured to allow ~120s for credential init. Auth Proxy sidecar has no startup probe — Cloud Run restarts on crash, more reliable than probing. Shared proxy flags in `local.cloud_sql_proxy_args`; bastion-only flags (`--address=0.0.0.0`, `--impersonate-service-account`) in `terraform/main/templates/bastion-cloud-init.yaml`. Debug heuristic: local works but Cloud Run fails = credential or VPC egress issue.

## Local Development

**docker-compose:** IAP tunnel container tunnels to bastion Auth Proxy via `network_mode: "service:app"` so the app reaches Cloud SQL at `localhost:5432` (same as Cloud Run). Requires `BASTION_INSTANCE`, `BASTION_ZONE`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` in `.env`. Developer IAM prerequisite: `roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor`. Editable install via `ARG editable=true`. Watch: `sync+restart` for `src/`, `rebuild` for deps. Binds `127.0.0.1:8000` (app) and `127.0.0.1:5432` (Postgres, for host DB clients through the tunnel). See `docs/references/docker-compose-workflow.md` for full workflow.

**Test deployed service:** `gcloud run services proxy <service-name> --project <project> --region <region> --port 8000`. Service name: `${agent_name}-${environment}` (e.g., `my-agent-dev`).

## Documentation Strategy

**CRITICAL:** Task-based organization (match developer mental model), not technical boundaries.

**Structure:**
- **README.md:** ~200 lines max. Quick start only. Points to docs/.
- **docs/*.md:** ~300 lines max. Action paths ("I want to..."). Index in `docs/README.md`.
- **docs/references/*.md:** No limit. Deep-dive technical docs. Optional follow-up. Index in `docs/references/README.md`.

**Rules:**
- Task-based, not tech-based (e.g., "Infrastructure" not "Terraform" + "CI/CD" separately)
- Hub-and-spoke navigation: `docs/README.md` and `docs/references/README.md` are the navigation indexes
- Inline cross-links only when critically contextual (hybrid approach)
- No "See Also" sections - rely on index navigation instead
- Single source of truth: env vars only in `docs/environment-variables.md`
- Update `docs/README.md` when adding docs
- Keep guides digestible (<300 lines). Move details to `references/`.

**Callouts:** Use GFM callout blocks (`> [!TYPE]`) sparingly — only when content genuinely warrants elevated attention. Don't use callouts for normal information. (`NOTE` = you should know this, `TIP` = this could help you, `IMPORTANT` = do this, `WARNING` = don't do that, `CAUTION` = this will destroy something)
