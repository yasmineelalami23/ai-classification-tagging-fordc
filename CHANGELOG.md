## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Workflow linting with actionlint `v1.7.12`, in two layers running the same tool with the same flags. A pre-commit hook gives feedback before push; an `actionlint` job in `ci.yml` is the gate that blocks a merge, since a hook only fires for contributors who ran `pre-commit install` and `--no-verify` skips it. The job is gated on a new `workflows` path filter (`.github/workflows/**`) and registered in the `status` sentinel that branch protection keys on, and it runs upstream's published `docker://rhysd/actionlint` image, since actionlint ships no first-party action. Both layers pass `-shellcheck=`, disabling the shellcheck pass over inline `run:` blocks: locally that pass runs only when shellcheck happens to be on `PATH`, and in CI it would be deterministic but fails on 59 pre-existing SC2086/SC2129 findings. Keeping the flag on both is what makes a clean commit imply a clean gate; it comes off both with those findings (#255). The version is pinned in two places, the hook's `rev` and the image tag, and `tests/unit/test_pinned_versions.py` fails the unit lane when they drift, since nothing else connects them and `pre-commit autoupdate` moves one on its own. `.pre-commit-config.yaml` joins `ci.yml`'s `code` paths filter so a rev-only bump still reaches that check (#215)
- Pre-commit coverage for the remaining non-Python file types: `terraform fmt` over `.tf` files, plus `check-json` and `check-merge-conflict` from the already-pinned hooks repo. The Terraform hook is the only fmt enforcement `terraform/bootstrap/**` has, since CI's `terraform fmt -check` runs with `working-directory: terraform/main`. `terraform validate` is not a hook: it needs `terraform init` per root, which is too slow for a commit (#215)
- `timezone_abbreviation` in the `get_current_time` result (`EDT`, `UTC`, and so on). The abbreviation is the form a model reaches for when rendering a time in prose, but deriving it from the timezone name and UTC offset takes daylight-saving knowledge the tool result did not carry, so the agent was asserting it ungrounded. The judge gate's `hallucinations_v1` metric caught this correctly: it scores each response sentence for entailment against the tool output and marked a response containing "EDT" unsupported while a response using only returned values passed. The field is `None` for the 231 of 598 IANA zones tzdata renders as a numeric offset, like `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` and `America/Sao_Paulo`, where an "abbreviation" would only restate `utc_offset`; the docstring directs the model to name the offset in that case (#213)
- Judge-eval CI gate (`.github/workflows/judge-eval.yml`): a reusable workflow that runs the App-aware in-process LLM-judge eval (`uv run pytest tests/eval -m "judge"`) under the eval lane's WIF-to-Vertex credential posture, so it scores the checked-out agent with no deployed revision, no service URL, and no invoker auth. `ci-cd.yml` calls it as `judge-eval` on merge to main: blocking in production mode, signal only in dev-only mode. Blocking is a `gating` input rather than `continue-on-error`, because a job that calls a reusable workflow may not use that keyword and the tag-time gate reads this job's conclusion. The model-liveness preflight runs as its own always-blocking step under a new `liveness` marker, and the judge test converts every non-assertion failure to a dedicated exit code, so the scored step's exit 1 can only mean a sub-threshold score: `gating: false` absorbs a behavioral regression, while a dead endpoint or a broken run fails the job in either mode and the summary names which. A separate always-run step writes that summary, so a failed preflight reports too. (#213)
- Inline review comments on the Claude PR review (`claude.yml`): line-specific findings now post on the lines they concern, with committable `suggestion` blocks, instead of collapsing into one tracking comment. Tag mode's tool allowlist is fixed, so `create_inline_comment` is granted via `claude_args`; without it the inline-comment MCP server never starts. Comment classification is disabled, since it runs only when an Anthropic API key is present and would otherwise make the set of posted comments depend on the auth path (#194)
- Direct-to-Anthropic auth for the Claude PR review (`claude.yml`): setting either the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repository secret (an Anthropic organization API key) or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (from `claude setup-token`) overrides the default Vertex AI path, so the review runs without Vertex model access. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` wins when both are set; Vertex AI remains the default when neither is. A new "Report model auth path" step names the selected path in the job log

### Changed
- Rename `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI` to `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE` across `.env.example`, `terraform/main/main.tf`, the `agent-eval` job in `ci.yml`, `judge-eval.yml`, and the docs. ADK 2.4.0 deprecated the old name, and every code path that resolves the variant warns on it, so a single judge eval run emitted 70 `DeprecationWarning`s and buried real warnings in CI logs. Both layers that read the variable already accept the new name and prefer it when both are set (ADK's `is_enterprise_mode_enabled`, `google-genai`'s `BaseApiClient`), so there is no transition period to manage and no reason to set both. The old name still resolves, so an existing local `.env` keeps working and keeps warning until it is edited; `docs/environment-variables.md` says so at the variable (#249)
- Raise `rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1` to `threshold: 0.9` in `tests/eval/data/full_eval_config.json`. The metric averages its two rubrics at equal weight, and ADK keys criteria by metric name so one threshold covers both. `concise` is near-certain to pass, which floors the score at `(R - 1) / R` = 0.5 and made the previous `0.7` clear with `answers_query` passing only two runs in five: an agent answering the user's actual question 40% of the time was passing the merge gate. 0.9 is what demands four of five on `answers_query` while `concise` stays the style hint it is. Both rubrics are kept so the template still demonstrates the multi-rubric shape; the arithmetic is documented in `docs/references/agent-evals.md` (#242)
- Raise `safety_v1` to `threshold: 1.0`. The metric delegates to the Vertex pointwise safety autorater, whose rubric is binary (1 safe, 0 unsafe), so averaged across `JUDGE_NUM_RUNS` the previous 0.8 was an allowance for one unsafe response in five. Because the per-invocation score has no partial-credit path, 1.0 tightens the gate at no flakiness cost (#242)
- Take ADK's sampling defaults for the judge metrics: `num_samples` and `judge_model_config` are removed from `tests/eval/data/full_eval_config.json`. Pinning the judge to `temperature: 0` and then paying for a 3-sample majority vote works against itself, since voting is self-consistency sampling and only extracts information when the samples can disagree. The config now sets a `judge_model` and a `threshold` and nothing else; forks wanting reproducibility over robustness should pair `temperature: 0` with `num_samples: 1` rather than mixing the two postures (#242)
- Drop the two deterministic criteria (`tool_trajectory_avg_score`, `response_match_score`) from `tests/eval/data/full_eval_config.json`. The PR gate already scores them from `test_config.json` at `DETERMINISTIC_NUM_RUNS`, and leaving them in the judge config re-scored them at `JUDGE_NUM_RUNS`, which silently turned an exact-match 1.0 threshold into a demand for five perfect trajectories where the PR gate demands two. That is a merge-only failure the PR gate can never reproduce, and it was justified nowhere; the merge gate now scores judge metrics only (#213)
- `--strict-markers` added to pytest `addopts`. The eval lane's markers select which CI step a test runs in, so an unregistered or misspelled marker now fails collection instead of emitting a warning and routing the test into the wrong step (#213)
- Drop `final_response_match_v2` from the shipped judge config (`tests/eval/data/full_eval_config.json`). It asks an LLM whether the response matches the case's `expected_response`, but the gate case asks for the current time and its reference is deliberately clock-free so ROUGE stays stable, so the reference names the timezone while every actual response states a time it lacks. The judge has no stable basis and splits roughly evenly: measured over four runs it scored exactly 0.5 against a 0.7 threshold every time, with the verdict uncorrelated with any observable difference. A ROUGE gate needs a clock-free reference and a semantic judge needs a complete one, and one case cannot serve both. The remaining judge metrics are reference-free and scored the case stably across the same runs (#213)
- Run counts are per gate: `JUDGE_NUM_RUNS = 5` and `DETERMINISTIC_NUM_RUNS = 2` replace the single shared value of 2 in `tests/eval/test_agent_eval.py`. Judge verdicts are binary per rubric, so a metric's achievable scores are the multiples of `1 / (rubrics x num_runs x invocations)`: at 2 runs a single-rubric, single-invocation metric can only score 0, 0.5, or 1, and every threshold above 0.5 silently demands unanimity while reading as if it tolerates one bad draw. Five runs give the average enough resolution for the shipped thresholds to mean what they say. The deterministic gate keeps 2: its tool-trajectory threshold wants unanimity, and ROUGE-1 is spaced finely enough to average at that size. ADK runs the passes serially, so the judge gate costs roughly 2.5x the wall clock it did (#213)
- `require-stage-success` now requires `Judge Eval` alongside `Apply Stage` and `Smoke Stage` for the tagged SHA, so a behavioral regression blocks the prod tag. Stage success remains the image-fidelity half of the gate; `Judge Eval` covers behavior, scoring the same commit's agent code in-process rather than a deployed revision, so it gates what the promoted digest carries without depending on the stage rollout. A regression reds the merge run after stage has already deployed, blocking the tag rather than reverting stage (#213)

### Fixed
- Close a script-injection path in `metadata-extract.yml`'s job summary. The branch name reached the step through `${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}` inside an unquoted heredoc, and GitHub substitutes expressions into the script text before the shell parses it, so a fork PR from a branch named with backticks or `$(...)` would execute in the runner. The value now arrives through a `BRANCH_NAME` environment variable. Found by the actionlint gate this change adds (#215)
- Judge gate now runs on a merge that changes only eval data. `ci-cd.yml`'s trigger allowlisted deployable content and excluded `tests/**`, so a commit editing the eval set, the judge config, or a threshold produced no judge run at all, which is exactly the commit that changes what the gate asserts. Path handling is now two layers with opposite polarity, matched to what each one risks getting wrong. The trigger is a `paths-ignore` denylist covering documentation and local-developer scaffolding, so it answers just "should a run start"; a path missing from it starts a run whose jobs all skip. A new `changes` job holds the allowlists that decide what actually runs: `build` gates on `deploy`, and `judge-eval` gates on `eval`, which is `deploy` plus `tests/eval/**`. An eval-data merge therefore scores the change and builds no image, which `judge-eval` was always able to do, since it scores the checked-out agent in-process and never depended on the build chain. Because every deploy job reaches `build` through `needs`, one condition skips the whole build-and-deploy chain. The path list that does something now exists in exactly one place, with `eval` reusing `deploy` through a YAML anchor that the action's own parser resolves. `require-stage-success` is unchanged: a merge that builds no image has no `Apply Stage` or `Smoke Stage` conclusion, so tagging it still fails closed, which is correct rather than a hole to patch and is now documented alongside the gate (#238)
- Remove the dead `num_samples` from `hallucinations_v1` in `tests/eval/data/full_eval_config.json`. `HallucinationsV1Evaluator` overrides `evaluate_invocations` and never enters the sampling loop, so the field bought nothing; the metric makes exactly two judge calls per response, a segmenter and a validator. Confirmed against the pinned ADK, upstream `main`, and ADK's criteria docs, which list only `judge_model` for this metric (#242)
- Correct the judge-threshold explanation in `docs/references/agent-evals.md` and AGENTS.md, which claimed resolution comes from `num_runs` alone. It comes from `rubrics x num_runs x invocations`, since ADK means every run's per-invocation scores in one flat list; sampling is a majority vote that buys reliability and no resolution; one judge call carries every rubric in a metric, so rubric count does not multiply LLM calls; `hallucinations_v1` has no fixed set of achievable scores at all, because it scores supported over total sentences and the agent does not write the same number of sentences each run; and ROUGE-1 is finely spaced rather than continuous, since its f-measure denominator counts the response's own tokens and so shifts run to run by the same mechanism, only at token scale instead of sentence scale. A new "How a judge score is built" section carries the aggregation funnel, the effective-threshold arithmetic, the rubric-subsidy floor, and the per-run call counts (#242)
- Agent eval gate no longer false-passes when model inference is entirely unavailable. ADK swallows per-case inference failures (403/quota/network) and drops the case from scoring, so `AgentEvaluator` passed vacuously over an empty metric set and a dead endpoint read as green. Preflight liveness probes now make one minimal live call per model role before the gates run, the agent's inference model and each judge autorater, and fail the lane fast (reporting the exact endpoint reply or error) when one is unreachable. Each probe reads its role's model from source (`ROOT_AGENT_MODEL`, `full_eval_config.json`), so swapping a model re-points its probe automatically (#229)

## [0.19.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- CI: make the `code-quality` job the sole writer of the shared uv cache in `ci.yml`. The `integration` and `agent-eval` jobs set `save-cache: false` on `astral-sh/setup-uv` so they restore the same key but no longer save it, removing the concurrent cache-reserve race that produced "Failed to save cache" warning annotations on a cold cache. All three jobs keep `enable-cache: true`, so cache reuse is unchanged (#227)

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Require-stage-success prod gate (`.github/workflows/require-stage-success.yml`): a tag-time, agent-agnostic gate that runs before `prod-promote` (and so before the `prod-apply` approval), so a failure halts the tag run before any reviewer is prompted. It finds the tagged commit's merge run and requires `Apply Stage` and `Smoke Stage` to have both concluded success, failing closed otherwise. Stage success is the whole gate: the promotion workflow copies the image digest-for-digest and prod deploys by digest, so prod runs exactly the digest stage validated. No digest comparison is needed: stage `{sha7}` is written only by that commit's own merge-run attempts and the tag run never rebuilds, so a green `Smoke Stage` (latest attempt) already means `{sha7}` resolves to the digest that was smoked (#211)
- Post-deploy smoke test lane (`tests/smoke/`): after each `terraform apply`, drives the live Cloud Run URL over the real network to confirm the new revision serves end to end. Layered cheapest-first so a failure localizes the broken subsystem (L0 `/health`, L1 session create + read-back, L2 a thin `/run_sse` turn asserting only that a text part streamed, L3 delete + 404), with a readiness wait that absorbs cold-start latency. Authenticates by impersonating a dedicated invoker SA in-process to mint a Cloud Run ID token, so the same code runs locally and in CI. Runs by explicit path only (`uv run pytest tests/smoke`); `ci-cd.yml` runs it after each environment apply (`dev-smoke`/`stage-smoke`/`prod-smoke`), not in the PR gate (#101)
- Dedicated smoke invoker service account (`terraform/main/smoke.tf`): a least-privilege identity with resource-scoped `roles/run.invoker`, plus `roles/iam.serviceAccountOpenIdTokenCreator` for the WIF principal so CI can mint the Cloud Run ID token by impersonation. `terraform-plan-apply.yml` exposes the service URL and invoker SA email as outputs for the smoke job (#101)
- App-aware agent eval: eval inference now runs the full `App` with its plugins applied (the global instruction, logging, and any fork-added plugins), so evals score the same agent `adk web` chat and the deployed server run, and LLM-judge metrics that read `app_details` (developer instructions + tool declarations) get real in-process context instead of empty context. A documented, prod-safe monkey-patch (`src/<pkg>/_eval_app_aware_patch.py`, applied at package import, an `except ModuleNotFoundError` no-op in the runtime image where eval deps are absent) restores App-awareness across all four dev eval surfaces (`uv run pytest tests/eval`, the `adk eval` CLI, the `adk web` eval tab, and `adk web` chat); removed once an equivalent fix lands upstream (adk-python#5503) (#212)
- Judge eval gate (`test_template_agent_judge_eval`): scores the agent against `full_eval_config.json` (rubric, hallucination, and safety metrics) via `AgentEvaluator.evaluate_eval_set`, App-aware in-process. Gated by a new `judge` pytest marker, separate from the deterministic PR gate; runs locally today (its own CI job is future work). Like every eval case it runs the agent with live inference (real Vertex creds); the judge metrics additionally call the paid Gen AI evaluation service (#212)
- `deterministic` and `judge` pytest markers on the eval lane, so the PR gate selects the deterministic cases by explicit opt-in (`-m "deterministic"`, so an unmarked live-model case can't leak into the fast gate) and the LLM-judged cases run on demand (#212)

### Changed
- Test-lane credential mocking is now per-lane instead of shared: the root `tests/conftest.py` moved to `tests/unit/conftest.py`, so its auth/dotenv `pytest_configure()` mocking scopes to the unit lane only. A smoke lane can run against real credentials without the shared conftest suppressing them
- Integration lane collapsed into a single module: the lane-level `tests/integration/conftest.py` is removed, with its fixtures, the `MockLlm` stub, and an autouse session fixture that blocks real credentials now inlined in `test_server_integration.py`
- Unit, integration, and eval lanes resolve the agent package name from `src/` at import time instead of hard-coding it, so a downstream fork that renames the package reuses every lane (and the eval gate) with no edits. The unit `conftest.py` builds its mock patch targets from the discovered name, so `init_template.py` no longer rewrites it and template syncs diff it clean
- Restructured `docs/references/testing.md` into the lane taxonomy plus the unit-test guide, splitting the integration lane into its own `docs/references/integration-tests.md` (added to the docs indexes and MkDocs nav); non-unit lanes now point to their own reference docs
- Integration test lane now provisions Postgres with `testcontainers`: `uv run pytest tests/integration` starts a throwaway `postgres:18` via the Docker daemon and tears it down at session end, so a running Docker daemon is the only prerequisite (no manual `docker run`). The `ci.yml` `integration` job drops its service container and uses the same path, so local and CI runs are identical and the image version lives in one place. Set `INTEGRATION_DATABASE_URI` to point the lane at an already-running Postgres. The `postgres:18` major still matches the deployed `POSTGRES_18` Cloud SQL version (previously a `postgres:17` service container)
- pytest now runs with `--import-mode=importlib` (pytest's recommended import mode for new projects), which keeps test directories free of `__init__.py` and avoids same-named modules colliding across lanes. Lane selection stays by explicit path; the registered `integration`/`smoke` markers are kept for ad-hoc `-m` selection (e.g. `-m "not integration"`)
- Move the agent eval lane from the top-level `eval/` directory to `tests/eval/`, grouping it with the other test lanes (it stays live-model-distinct by loading the real `.env` itself). The deterministic PR gate now runs `uv run pytest tests/eval -m "deterministic"` (was `uv run pytest eval`) (#212)
- Upgrade `google-adk` to 2.4.0 and the OpenTelemetry stack (API/SDK 1.42.1, instrumentation 0.63b1). Migrate the logging bridge to `LoggingInstrumentor().instrument(log_code_attributes=True)`, which now owns root-logger handler attachment: drop the manual SDK `LoggingHandler` (deprecated upstream; keeping it alongside the upgraded instrumentor would double-export every log record) while retaining the `code.file.path`/`function.name`/`line.number` attributes. Cap the fastapi and logging instrumentors at `<0.64`: ADK pins `opentelemetry-api<=1.42.1`, and the 0.64b0 line requires api 1.43.0 (via `semantic-conventions`), so it cannot resolve in an ADK project. Remove the obsolete `LogDeprecatedInitWarning` filter (the symbol was removed upstream) (#225)

### Fixed
- `docs/references/agent-evals.md` is now listed in the MkDocs site nav (previously reachable only through the docs index pages)

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- Integration test lane (`tests/integration/`): exercises the real FastAPI app against a real Postgres session service with no mocks, covering session create/list/get/delete, an agent run that persists and reads session state, and FK cascade-on-delete (a raw `DELETE` on `sessions` removes the session's events through the Postgres `ON DELETE CASCADE`, the database-level path the `pg_cron` retention job relies on). Builds the production app via ADK `get_fast_api_app()` with a `postgresql+asyncpg://` URI and drives it in-process with httpx `ASGITransport`; the LLM is stubbed so the lane is deterministic and free. Includes a Postgres-dialect strictness test (asyncpg rejects ISO strings for `timestamptz` where sqlite tolerates them). Runs in the `ci.yml` required check via a `postgres:17` service container, gated on `changes` and folded into the `CI / status` sentinel, without `--cov` (#102)
- Agent eval harness in a top-level `eval/` lane (separate from `tests/` because it calls the live model): `eval/data/template_agent.evalset.json` (ADK `EvalSet` schema) with a deterministic `get_current_time` tool-trajectory case, and `test_config.json` deterministic PR-gate criteria (`tool_trajectory_avg_score` IN_ORDER 1.0 + `response_match_score` ROUGE-1 0.4) (#104)
- Gate-fidelity pytest eval runner (`uv run pytest eval`) calling `AgentEvaluator.evaluate()`, which raises on sub-threshold metrics — unlike the `adk eval` CLI, which exits 0 even when cases fail (verified against google-adk 2.2.0) and remains the interactive authoring loop only (#104)
- `agent-eval` CI job: deterministic agent eval gate on every code PR, authenticating to Vertex AI with the dev environment's WIF principal; the always-run `status` sentinel now requires it, so the existing `CI / status` required check blocks merges on eval failures (#104)
- `google-adk[eval]` dev extra for the agent eval lane, providing `AgentEvaluator` and its deterministic-metric dependencies (dev-only; no runtime or image impact) (#104)
- Full ADK eval-surface coverage as thin, runnable examples: a scripted multi-turn case (`multi_turn.evalset.json`), the `.test.json` single-file format (`simple_time_query.test.json`), dynamic user simulation (`conversation_scenarios.json` with a pre-built and a custom persona, `session_input.json`, `user_sim_config.json`), and an expanded `full_eval_config.json` covering judge, rubric, hallucination, and safety metrics (`final_response_match_v2`, `rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1`, `rubric_based_tool_use_quality_v1`, `hallucinations_v1`, `safety_v1`) for local deep evaluation (#104)
- `tests/unit/test_eval_artifacts.py`: schema-validates every eval data file (eval sets, criteria configs, conversation scenarios, session input) against the installed ADK schemas and metric registry on each PR, so malformed eval data fails in the fast unit lane with no LLM cost (#104)
- `docs/references/agent-evals.md`: the complete agent-evaluation map — data formats, every run path (`uv run server` dev UI, `uv run pytest eval`, `adk eval`/`adk test`/`adk eval_set`/`adk optimize`/`adk migrate`), a metrics table, the deterministic CI gate, dynamic user simulation, a Limits-and-gotchas section (cross-session memory is integration-tested not eval-tested, the deterministic-gate rationale, thinking-mode tool bypass, app-name match, eval-service region), and a Relationship-to-the-Agent-Platform-Eval-SDK section that records why the template stays ADK-native and where regression-diff/failure-clustering live instead — with ADK's docs as the source of truth for mechanics (#104)

### Changed
- Upgrade `google-adk` to 2.2.0 and declare its `[gcp,otel-gcp]` extras. ADK 2.x no longer pulls the Vertex/Agent Engine (`aiplatform`), GCS, and GCP OpenTelemetry dependencies by default; the extras restore them for the Agent Engine memory service, the GCS artifact service, and Cloud Trace/Logging export. Raise the `opentelemetry-instrumentation-google-genai` floor to `>=0.7b1` (earlier builds capped `google-genai<2` and silently skipped GenAI instrumentation under ADK 2.x)

### Removed
- Drop the preventive `litellm<=1.82.6` constraint-dependency. The supply-chain compromise that prompted it is contained: the two malicious versions (1.82.7, 1.82.8) are deleted from PyPI and all current releases are verified clean ([BerriAI/litellm#24518](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/24518)). The `exclude-newer` dependency cooldown remains the general guard against newly-compromised packages, so no version-specific litellm pin is needed. Unblocks the `google-adk[eval]` extra

### Fixed
- Drop the per-turn microsecond timestamp from the global instruction; use day-precision date so the cached system-instruction prefix holds across a session, fixing Gemini/Anthropic prompt-cache misses every turn (#199)

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- `docs/references/image-digest-resolution.md`: how one build surfaces as different digests across Artifact Registry tags (OCI index), Cloud Run revisions (platform manifest), and the provenance attestation — with resolution commands, console paths, and digest-based debugging recipes. Restores and modernizes content dropped in the February docs refactor
- `verify-image-provenance` project skill: operationalizes the digest-resolution doc as a deterministic procedure (`resolve_chain.sh` with service/compare/revision/tag/classify/find-commit modes) answering image-identity questions with digest evidence — same-image checks across revisions, running-image-to-commit/PR attribution, artifact classification, and deploy-chain verification. Eval-validated across models

### Changed
- `sync-foundation` skill: add a doc-reuse principle to Phase 8 (Documentation) mirroring the Phase 1 fixture-reuse principle — prefer verbatim reuse of upstream docs and isolate unavoidable divergence into bounded blocks, so future syncs evaluate docs as fast verbatim diffs rather than line-by-line reconciliation (#191)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-04

### Changed
- Flatten `src/<pkg>/utils/` into the package root: `utils/config.py` → `config.py`, `utils/observability.py` → `observability.py`; the `utils/__init__.py` re-export facade is removed and `server.py` imports from the modules directly. Forks syncing past this release: apply the same moves, update imports (`from .utils import X` → `from .config import X` / `from .observability import X`), test patch targets (`<pkg>.utils.config.load_dotenv` → `<pkg>.config.load_dotenv` in `conftest.py`), and the coverage omit path in `pyproject.toml` (#186)
- Reorganize `tests/` into explicit `unit/`, `integration/`, `smoke/`, and `eval/` lane directories; existing test modules move to `tests/unit/`. A lane is decided by runtime requirements and determinism; non-unit lanes run by explicit path and `testpaths = ["tests/unit"]` scopes a bare `pytest` to the fast, free, deterministic lane with the 100% coverage gate. Lane markers registered in `pyproject.toml` (#177)
- Establish the mirror-source test naming convention: test module path mirrors source path (`src/<pkg>/config.py` → `tests/unit/test_config.py`); nested source paths flatten with underscores (#177, #186)

### Removed
- `tests/test_integration.py`: in-process structural assertions on coverage-omitted modules, not integration tests. App/agent wiring will be validated by the real integration lane, freeing the name for the Postgres + FastAPI suite (#177)

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- Scheduled session-data cleanup via `pg_cron`: a daily job deletes `sessions` older than 90 days (`events` cascade via the FK), closing the `DatabaseSessionService` no-server-side-TTL storage gap. Provisioned with no application code, via the `cloudsql.enable_pg_cron` flag and an idempotent bootstrap in the bastion cloud-init. Runs and failures are observable by default through `cron.job_run_details` and the instance Postgres logs in Cloud Logging (#182)
- Local Cloud SQL access from the host: `docker-compose.yml` publishes `127.0.0.1:5432:5432`, so a laptop DB client reaches Cloud SQL through the existing IAP tunnel and bastion Auth Proxy as the app SA (#181)
- Design rationale in `docs/references/cloud-sql.md` for DELETE-based session cleanup over pg_partman partition expiry: ADK owns the schema, idle-based retention keys on the mutable `update_time`, and the bounded sweep keeps the zero-application-code property (#184)

## [0.14.1] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- Consolidate Test Suite Typing Strategy in `docs/references/code-quality.md` as the single source of truth (mypy scoped to src/, conftest by convention) and catalog expected mypy error categories from `uv run mypy src tests`. `docs/references/testing.md` and `AGENTS.md` now point at it (#173)

### Removed
- Dead `[[tool.mypy.overrides]] module = "tests.*"` block from `pyproject.toml`. mypy was already scoped to `packages = ["agent_foundation"]`, so the override never fired — its presence misled readers about what was actually being checked (#173)

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Optional `image_name` and `context` overrides on `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` to support building subproject images alongside the primary app
- Optional `image_name` override on `.github/workflows/pull-and-promote.yml` (applies to both source and target by design — image name stays static across environments)
- Optional `image_name` override on `.github/workflows/resolve-image-digest.yml`
- Subproject Builds section in `docs/references/cicd.md` covering the override pattern, the per-context `.dockerignore` gotcha, the per-subproject CI lane recipe, and the rationale for not exposing a `registry` override
- Consumer Extension Points entries in `AGENTS.md` for adding a CI lane and adding a subproject Docker image to the deploy pipeline
- Migration bullet in `docs/references/protection-strategies.md` Prerequisites for renamed required-status checks (do the swap on the PR before merging to avoid an unprotected window)
- Local `pre-commit` hooks via `.pre-commit-config.yaml` covering trailing whitespace, end-of-file, YAML, TOML, large-file checks, `uv-lock` sync, and `language: system` hooks for ruff format, ruff check, and mypy (#168)
- Pre-commit Hooks subsection in `docs/development.md` covering install, manual invocation patterns, and the `language: system` autoupdate caveat (#170)
- Consumer Extension Points row in `AGENTS.md` pointing at ADK model selection for swapping the LLM (Gemini string, Model Garden endpoint, LiteLlm/MaaS connectors) (#143)

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Required status check renamed from `Required Checks / required-status` to `CI / status`. Consumers with branch protection configured must update the required check name (see `docs/references/protection-strategies.md` Prerequisites for the migration path)
- **BREAKING:** Rename `terraform/main` outputs for consistent `app_*` / `bastion_*` prefixes:
  `deployed_image` → `app_deployed_image`, `service_account_email` → `app_service_account_email`,
  `service_account_roles` → `app_service_account_roles`, `cloud_run_services` → `app_cloud_run_services`,
  `configured_environment_variables` → `app_environment_variables`
- `app_environment_variables` now reflects the deployed Cloud Run service env, not the configured input
- **BREAKING:** Replace `uri` (string) with `urls` (list) in `app_cloud_run_services.<location>` to surface all
  configured service URLs (deterministic and random) for auditability
- Consolidated `code-quality.yml` and `required-checks.yml` into a single self-contained `ci.yml` workflow with three jobs (`changes`, `code-quality`, `status`)
- Use the official Claude GitHub Action app for PR automation; remove explicit GitHub token from job step inputs (#156)
- Upgrade `google-adk` pin `1.30.0` → `1.33.0` (#171)

### Removed
- `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml` (consolidated into `ci.yml`)
- `.github/workflows/required-checks.yml` (consolidated into `ci.yml`)
- `workflow_dispatch` and `workflow_call` triggers from the code-quality pipeline (intentional — neither was invoked, and `ci.yml` is now self-contained)

### Fixed
- Replace `instanceAdmin.v1` with `compute.admin` in bootstrap WIF roles to unblock first-time VPC creation (#167)

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-21

- `gen_ai.usage.reasoning_tokens` span attribute and `reasoning_tokens` log entry, sourced from Gemini's `thoughts_token_count` (#153)
- `gen_ai.usage.tool_use.input_tokens` span attribute and `tool_use_tokens` log entry, sourced from `tool_use_prompt_token_count` (#153)
- Cloud Run Concurrency Tuning reference doc — runtime model, memory math, GIL / multi-process tradeoffs, and starting-point profile for async Python agents (#153)
- Test Double Naming convention in testing reference (`Mock` / `mock_` / `create_mock_` prefixes) and AGENTS.md (#153)
- `asyncpg` type strictness note in AGENTS.md (bind typed columns as native Python objects, not ISO strings) (#153)
- Session state security posture section in security reference — encryption at rest, user isolation, value-safe logging, ADK OAuth2 credential refresher (#152)

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Rename `gen_ai.usage.experimental.cached_tokens` span attribute to canonical `gen_ai.usage.cache_read.input_tokens` per OTel semantic conventions — update any dashboards or alerts keyed on the old name (#153)
- Upgrade `google-adk` pin `1.28.0` → `1.30.0` (#154)
- Filter ADK `PLUGGABLE_AUTH` experimental `UserWarning` by source module in `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` (#154)

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** `total_tokens` entry from `after_model` token usage log line and `gen_ai.usage.experimental.total_tokens` span attribute — derive from component counts instead (no semconv equivalent exists); update any dashboards or alerts that referenced the old attribute (#153)

## [0.12.5] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Replace `PreloadMemoryTool` with the `load_memory` function tool in `agent.py` — memory is now retrieved on-demand when the LLM decides it is needed, rather than eager-preloaded into context on every turn (#150)
- Add explicit empty-password colon to `SESSION_SERVICE_URI` in `terraform/main/main.tf` (`user@` → `user:@`) to align with the documented example in `docs/environment-variables.md` and self-document intentional empty password under IAM database auth (#150)
- Document memory read/write paths in AGENTS.md Architecture Overview (`load_memory` tool with auto-appended ADK instruction; `add_session_to_memory` after-agent callback) (#150)

### Removed
- Stale `PydanticDeprecatedSince212` warning filter from `pyproject.toml` — no longer triggered by current dependencies (#150)

## [0.12.4] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- "How to Maintain This File" meta-instructions in AGENTS.md with pointer-over-enumeration principle, template internals framing, and intentional global-rule duplication note (#148)
- Consumer Extension Points table in AGENTS.md mapping "I want to add X" intent to file locations (#148)
- Pointer-over-enumeration guidance in memorizer agent instructions with template/scaffold exception for intentional global-rule duplication (#148)

### Changed
- Restructure AGENTS.md to optimize default token consumption for AI sessions — replace stale-prone enumerations with source-of-truth pointers, convert dense prose to scannable bullets, mark template internals with soft framing (#148)
- Wrap `get_current_time` with `FunctionTool` in `agent.py` to match documented custom-tool pattern (#148)
- Use Python basename convention in AGENTS.md to reduce package-path substitution sites in downstream forks after `init_template.py` runs (#148)

- Add `-backend=false` to lockfile upgrade documentation (#145)

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-05

### Changed
- Remove unnecessary env var assignments from `pytest_configure()` — no module in the test import graph reads env vars at collection time (#141)
- Update testing guide and AGENTS.md to document when `pytest_configure()` env vars are needed (#141)

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- `/sync-foundation` skill for interactive template sync workflow with 9-phase review order, IDE-agnostic diffs, per-file HITL checkpoints, and conftest fixture reuse strategy (#139)

- `test_callbacks_omit_falsy_state_keys` test for state key filtering behavior (#139)

### Changed
- Split docker-compose restart policies: app `no` (clean crash output), IAP tunnel `unless-stopped` (auto-reconnect) (#139)
- Remove trailing punctuation from docstring list items in config module (#139)

### Fixed

### Added
- Cloud SQL Postgres with private IP and IAM database auth for session persistence via ADK `DatabaseSessionService`
- VPC network with Private Services Access peering for Cloud SQL private IP connectivity

- Add `time_sleep` for Cloud SQL IAM user creation race condition on initial provisioning (#126)
- Add explicit `edition = "ENTERPRISE"` to Cloud SQL to prevent provider default drift (#125)
- `ALLOW_ORIGINS` missing `localhost:8000` — required by ADK >=1.27.3 `_OriginCheckMiddleware` exact string matching (#131)

### Removed
- `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL` environment variable — model selection is now a module constant in `agent.py` (#114)
- `agent_engine_uri` property from `ServerEnv` — URI construction moved to Terraform
- `root_agent_model` Terraform variable and CI/CD mapping
- `CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME` environment variable (replaced by `BASTION_INSTANCE`/`BASTION_ZONE`)
- `data/` volume mount from docker-compose (unused)

- Update bootstrap docs with deployment branch and tag protection rules
- Update job summaries pattern and project structure descriptions

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- `terraform/bootstrap/pre/` module creates GCS state buckets (one per environment) before bootstrap — supports incremental provisioning
- `terraform/main/services.tf` — consumer extension point for additional GCP API enablement; `time_sleep.service_enablement_propagation` (120s, `for_each` per service) guards against async backend initialization after API enablement
- `terraform/main/iam.tf` — consumer extension point for additional WIF principal IAM roles; `time_sleep.wif_iam_propagation` (120s, `for_each` per role) sequences role grants before dependent resource creation
- Bootstrap exports `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_PRINCIPAL_IDENTIFIER` as a GitHub Environment Variable, enabling `iam.tf` to bind additional roles to the WIF principal in CI/CD

### Changed
- Bootstrap environments now use GCS remote state with `bootstrap/` prefix; `terraform_state_bucket` is now a required input in all bootstrap roots
- `terraform/main/.terraform.lock.hcl` committed with multi-platform hashes (`linux_amd64`, `darwin_arm64`); locks provider versions for CI/CD stability

- `docs/production-environment-strategy.md` for future multi-environment planning

### Changed
- Changed default Terraform workspace from `sandbox` to `default` in CI/CD workflows to use Terraform's built-in default workspace while maintaining extensibility for multi-environment deployments (dev/stage/prod)
- Reorganized `.env.example` with purpose-based grouping (Required, GitHub CI/CD, Optional) and corrected variable names
- Bootstrap module now creates GCS bucket for main module's remote state and adds storage.objectUser role for state bucket access
- Main module now uses remote state in GCS (bucket created by bootstrap) with workspace isolation
- Cloud Run deployment now integrates with Vertex AI Reasoning Engine via `AGENT_ENGINE` environment variable

### Removed
- `docs/github-docker-setup.md` (replaced by comprehensive cicd-setup.md)
- `.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml` (superseded by reusable workflow pattern)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (historical planning document, core implementation complete, architecture decisions preserved in terraform-infrastructure.md and cicd-setup.md)

### Fixed
- Documented IAM bucket access limitation in artifact storage bucket variable (project-level storage roles only work within same GCP project, cross-project access requires additional configuration)
- Cloud Run startup probe configuration now uses HTTP health checks with resilient retry strategy (5 attempts over 120 seconds) to handle container initialization delays
- Inline comment justifying `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` role requirement for Cloud Run service account attachment during deployment
- Documentation of `coalesce()` usage for empty string vs null handling in Terraform variables
- "Terraform Variable Overrides" section in terraform-infrastructure.md documenting GitHub Actions Variables pattern
- "IAM and Permissions Model" section in terraform-infrastructure.md documenting project-level IAM assumptions and cross-project limitations

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- CODEOWNERS file with fresh template replacement during init
- Init script now updates GitHub Actions badge URLs to point to new repository
- Init script now resets version to 0.1.0 in pyproject.toml
- Terraform infrastructure-as-code for GCP and GitHub configuration
- `terraform/bootstrap/` module for initial infrastructure (Workload Identity Federation, Artifact Registry, Reasoning Engine)
- `terraform/main/` module for Cloud Run deployment
- Automated GitHub Actions Variables creation via Terraform
- Artifact Registry cleanup policies (age-based deletion with version count protection and buildcache exemption)
- Required Terraform configuration entries in `.env.example` (AGENT_NAME, GITHUB_REPO_NAME, GITHUB_REPO_OWNER)

### Changed
- Init script now removes template author from pyproject.toml (developers no longer inherit template author info)
- Refactored GitHub info parsing to use tuples directly (removed dict conversion step)
- Made `github_owner` required in TemplateConfig (parsing is all-or-nothing)
- Improved agent directory discovery in server.py with file-based path resolution (using `.resolve()` for absolute paths and symlink resolution) and environment variable override
- GitHub Actions workflows now use Variables instead of Secrets for non-sensitive identifiers (GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER)
- Renamed `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_URL` to `ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_URI` for accuracy
- Simplified `AGENT_ENGINE_URI` to `AGENT_ENGINE` (URI prefix `agentengine://` now added in code)
- Server now defaults to `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for explicit IPv4 binding
- Dockerfile now explicitly sets `PORT=8000` environment variable for consistency
- `RELOAD_AGENTS` environment variable added for optional agent hot reloading (defaults to false)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- Template initialization script (`init_template.py`) with dry-run mode.
- Init script audit logs (`init_template_results.md`, `init_template_dry_run.md`) for change tracking
- Template setup documentation in README.md and docs/development.md
- InstructionProvider pattern for dynamic instruction generation (enables current dates, session-aware customization)
- MockReadonlyContext fixture in conftest.py for InstructionProvider testing
- Comprehensive prompt function tests (test_prompt.py, 13 tests)
- Integration tests for component wiring (test_integration.py, 5 tests)
- InstructionProvider pattern documentation in CLAUDE.md

### Changed
- Restructured package from nested `agent/` directory to flat structure (`agent.py`, `callbacks.py`, `tools.py`, `prompt.py` at root)
- Updated `global_instruction` to use InstructionProvider callable pattern instead of static string
- Sorted `LlmAgent` parameters in agent.py to match ADK field order
- Updated coverage exclusions in pyproject.toml (removed prompt.py, updated paths to flat structure)
- Updated test imports after package restructure (all existing tests passing)
- Docker Compose container name adds `-local` suffix
- Health endpoint response from `{"status": "healthy"}` to `{"status": "ok"}`
- Simplified development.md with project-specific examples
- Moved project structure documentation from README.md to development.md only

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-12

### Added
- Google ADK agent with Gemini model integration and FastAPI server
- Dual authentication: Gemini Developer API or Vertex AI
- Agent lifecycle callbacks for logging and memory persistence (no short-circuits, all return None)
- Comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
- Environment variable parsing utility for safe JSON list handling with validation and fallback
- Multi-stage Docker build with uv optimization (~200MB runtime image, 5-10s rebuilds)
- Docker Compose with hot reloading (instant sync for code changes)
- Code quality tooling: ruff, mypy (strict), pytest (100% coverage)
- GitHub Actions workflows for quality checks and Docker builds
- Comprehensive documentation (README, development guides, Docker strategy, CLAUDE.md)
- Environment-based configuration with optional Agent Engine and GCS integration
- `.vscode/settings.json` to configure Pylance (excludes tests from type checking)

### Configuration
- Type checking excludes tests (standard pytest pattern): mypy checks only production code
- Ruff excludes notebooks from linting
- Notebooks for Agent Engine creation
