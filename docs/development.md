# Development

Day-to-day development workflow, code quality, testing, and Docker.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Configure cloud resource values in `.env` after first deployment. See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for initial setup and [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md) for complete reference.

## Quick Start

**Local-only** (cloud resource URIs commented out in `.env`):
```bash
uv run server                              # API at 127.0.0.1:8000 (SQLite sessions, in-memory storage)
SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE=TRUE uv run server     # With ADK web UI
```

**Standard development** (mirrors production, requires deployed cloud resource URIs configured in `.env`):
```bash
docker compose up --build --watch          # Cloud SQL (via IAP tunnel), Agent Engine, GCS
```

Both modes always export traces and structured logs to Cloud Trace and Cloud Logging. Set `TELEMETRY_NAMESPACE` in `.env` to a unique value (e.g., your name) so teammates can filter to your traces when reviewing experiments.

**Prerequisites:**
- `.env` file configured with required authentication and identification values (copy from `.env.example`)
- `gcloud auth application-default login` (for Vertex AI and telemetry)

See [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for initial setup.

## Environment Setup

Configure your local `.env` file after completing your first deployment. The deployed resources provide production-ready persistence for sessions, memory, and artifacts.

### 1. Create .env File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Edit `.env` and configure required values. The `.env.example` file includes inline comments for each variable.

**Required configuration:**
- Google Cloud Vertex AI credentials
- Agent identification
- OpenTelemetry settings

**Recommended (after first deployment):**
- `BASTION_INSTANCE` - Bastion host name for IAP tunnel (docker-compose)
- `BASTION_ZONE` - Bastion host zone for IAP tunnel (docker-compose)
- `SESSION_SERVICE_URI` - Session persistence (Cloud SQL)
- `MEMORY_SERVICE_URI` - Memory persistence (Agent Engine)
- `ARTIFACT_SERVICE_URI` - Artifact storage

See [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md) for complete reference.

### 3. Verify Configuration

```bash
# Check auth
gcloud auth application-default login

# Verify with Docker Compose (starts server and connects to cloud resources configured above)
docker compose up --build --watch
```

See [Environment Variables](environment-variables.md) for complete reference.

## Feature Branch Workflow

```bash
# Create branch (feat/, fix/, docs/, refactor/, test/)
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# Develop locally
docker compose up --build --watch  # Standard (cloud resources, mirrors production)
# Or: uv run server                # Local-only with cloud resource URIs commented out in .env

# Quality checks before commit (100% coverage required)
# Pre-commit automates format/lint/typecheck if installed
uv run ruff format && uv run ruff check && uv run mypy
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing

# Commit (Conventional Commits: 50 char title, list body)
git add . && git commit -m "feat: add new tool"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
gh pr create  # Follow PR format: What, Why, How, Tests

# After merge to main, monitor deployment
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --limit 5
gh run view --log
```

GitHub Actions automatically builds, tests, and deploys to Cloud Run. Check job summary for deployment details.

## Code Quality & Testing

Run format, lint, type check, and unit tests (100% coverage required) **before every commit**

**Standards:**
- **Type Hints:** Strict mypy, modern Python 3.13+ syntax (`|` unions, lowercase generics)
- **Code Style:** Ruff enforced (88-char lines, `Path` objects, security checks)
- **Docstrings:** Google-style format (args, returns, exceptions)
- **Testing:** 100% coverage on production code, exclusions for configuration modules, fixtures in `conftest.py`, test behaviors and errors

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit runs format, lint, and type checks as a fix-in-place git hook on every `git commit`. It does not run pytest, so coverage validation still requires `uv run pytest --cov`.

Coverage spans Python (ruff, mypy), Terraform (`terraform fmt`), GitHub Actions workflows (actionlint), and the YAML/TOML/JSON config files.

Workflow linting runs in two places on purpose. The hook catches problems before you push; the `actionlint` job in `ci.yml` is the gate that actually blocks a merge, since a hook only fires for contributors who ran `pre-commit install` and `--no-verify` skips it. Both pin the same version and pass the same flags, so a clean commit means a clean gate. Bump them together.

`terraform validate` is deliberately not a hook: it needs `terraform init` per root, which is too slow for a commit. CI validates instead. And note that CI's `terraform fmt -check` runs against `terraform/main` only, so the hook is the sole formatting gate for `terraform/bootstrap/**`.

**Local tooling:** the Terraform hook calls the `terraform` binary, already required for infrastructure work. actionlint needs nothing installed — pre-commit builds it, using the Go toolchain on `PATH` if there is one and otherwise downloading one into its own cache.

**One-time setup** (writes `.git/hooks/pre-commit`):

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

**Manual invocation:**

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files              # All hooks on all tracked files
uv run pre-commit run --files path/to/file     # Scope to specific files
uv run pre-commit run ruff-format              # Run a single hook
```

Hooks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. `pre-commit autoupdate` is a no-op for the `language: system` hooks, so update those at their own source:

| Hook | Version comes from | Update with |
|---|---|---|
| ruff, mypy | `uv.lock` | `uv lock --upgrade` |
| terraform fmt | the `terraform` binary on `PATH` | your system package manager |
| actionlint | the pinned `rev` here **and** the `docker://rhysd/actionlint:<ver>` tag in `ci.yml` | bump both together; `tests/unit/test_pinned_versions.py` fails if they drift |
| everything else | the pinned `rev` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | `pre-commit autoupdate` |

### Agent Evals

Run the deterministic agent eval gate before merging changes that touch agent behavior (instructions, tools, callbacks, model):

```bash
uv run pytest tests/eval -m "deterministic"  # real model inference, deterministic scoring; needs Vertex creds from .env
```

See [Agent Evals](references/agent-evals.md) for the full evaluation suite reference.

See [Testing Strategy](references/testing.md) and [Code Quality](references/code-quality.md) references for detailed patterns, tool usage, and exclusion strategies.

## Docker Compose for Standard Development

Docker Compose reads `.env` values and mirrors the production Cloud Run architecture: IAP tunnel to bastion → Auth Proxy → Cloud SQL private IP, with file sync and auto-restart (~2-5s feedback loop).

```bash
# Start with watch mode (leave running)
docker compose up --build --watch

# Changes in src/ sync instantly
# Changes in pyproject.toml or uv.lock trigger rebuild

# Stop: Ctrl+C or docker compose down
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Docker Compose requires `roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor` on your Google account for IAP tunnel access. Grant via `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding` or GCP Console.

**Key details:**
- IAP tunnel container connects to bastion host running Auth Proxy, sharing app's localhost via `network_mode: "service:app"`
- App connects to `localhost:5432` identically to Cloud Run
- Source files sync to container without rebuild (instant feedback)
- Loads `.env` automatically for configuration
- Multi-stage Dockerfile optimized with uv cache mounts (~80% faster rebuilds)
- Non-root container (~200MB final image)

## Local-Only (uv run server)

`uv run server` reads `.env` like Docker Compose. With cloud resource URIs set, it connects to those services. For fully local development, comment out `SESSION_SERVICE_URI`, `MEMORY_SERVICE_URI`, and `ARTIFACT_SERVICE_URI` in `.env`. Sessions persist locally in SQLite (`.adk/` directory). Traces and logs still export to Cloud Trace and Cloud Logging.

```bash
uv run server                              # Uses cloud resources if URIs set, local storage if unset
SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE=TRUE uv run server     # With ADK web UI
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG uv run server              # Debug logging
```

You can also connect `uv run server` to Cloud SQL, Agent Engine, or GCS selectively by setting individual service URI environment variables. See [Cloud Backend Options](references/cloud-backend-options.md) for manual IAP tunnel setup and selective backend options.

See [Docker Compose Workflow](references/docker-compose-workflow.md) and [Dockerfile Strategy](references/dockerfile-strategy.md) for details on watch mode, volumes, layer optimization, and security.

## Common Tasks

### Dependencies

```bash
# Add runtime dependency
uv add package-name

# Add dev dependency
uv add --group dev package-name

# Update all dependencies
uv lock --upgrade

# Update specific package
uv lock --upgrade-package package-name

# After updating pyproject.toml or uv.lock:
# - Locally: Restart server or Docker Compose (auto-rebuild with watch)
# - CI/CD: Commit both files together (required for --locked to pass)
```

### Version Bump

When bumping version in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
# Edit version in pyproject.toml
# Then update lockfile
uv lock

# Commit both together
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
git commit -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
```

**Why:** CI uses `uv sync --locked` which will fail if lockfile is out of sync.

### Custom GCP Services or IAM Roles

Need a new GCP API or WIF IAM role for your feature? Add it to the designated main module extension points — no bootstrap re-run or admin required.

- **`terraform/main/services.tf`** — add to the `services` set to enable a GCP API
- **`terraform/main/iam.tf`** — add to the `wif_additional_roles` set to grant the GitHub Actions WIF principal a new role

Add the roles or services AND the resources that use them in the same PR. The `time_sleep` resources handle propagation within the apply — declare `depends_on` on the correct sleep instance(s) for any resource that requires a newly-enabled service or role.

See [Extending the Main Module](references/bootstrap.md#extending-the-main-module) for the full pattern, code examples, and rationale.

### Test Deployed Service

Proxy Cloud Run service to test locally:

```bash
# Service name format: ${agent_name}-${environment}
gcloud run services proxy <service-name> \
  --project <project-id> \
  --region <region> \
  --port 8000

# Test
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# With web UI (if SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE=TRUE)
open http://localhost:8000

# Stop proxy: Ctrl+C
```

See [Cloud Run proxy documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/developers#proxy).

### Observability

**Server Logs:**
- Print to stdout (via LoggingPlugin callbacks)
- Basic request/response logging for immediate feedback

**Opentelemetry Traces and Logs:**
- Detailed traces → Cloud Trace
- Structured logs → Cloud Logging
- Full correlation between traces and logs

See [Observability](observability.md) for querying, filtering, and trace analysis.
