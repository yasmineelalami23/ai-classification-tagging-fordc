# Getting Started

First-time setup: from zero to deployed.

> [!NOTE]
> Bootstrap is a one-time setup per GitHub Environment. After successful bootstrap and first deployment, use the feature branch workflow described in [Development](development.md).

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.14.0
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) (gcloud CLI)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (gh)
- Python 3.13+
- `uv` package manager
- `jq` command-line JSON processor (for parsing Terraform output)

**GCP Project:**
- Create a new GCP project (or use existing)
- Enable billing
- Owner role

**GitHub Repository:**
- Create a new repository from this template
- Admin access (for GitHub Environments and Variables)

## Bootstrap CI/CD

Bootstrap creates the infrastructure for automated deployments:
- Workload Identity Federation for keyless GitHub Actions authentication
- Artifact Registry for Docker image storage with cleanup policies
- Remote Terraform state (GCS) for bootstrap and main module — bucket created by pre-bootstrap
- GitHub Environment and Variables for CI/CD

### 1. Authenticate

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID  # Optional
gh auth login
```

### 2. Create State Buckets (Pre-Bootstrap)

Pre-bootstrap creates the GCS state buckets used by bootstrap and the main module. Run it before bootstrapping each environment — start with dev only, or provision all three environments at once.

```bash
cp terraform/bootstrap/pre/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/bootstrap/pre/terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars: set agent_name and GCP project IDs

terraform -chdir=terraform/bootstrap/pre init
terraform -chdir=terraform/bootstrap/pre apply
```

See [Bootstrap Reference: Pre-Bootstrap](references/bootstrap.md#pre-bootstrap) for scope options (dev-only, full production, incremental) and how to skip pre-bootstrap if you already have a GCS bucket.

### 3. Configure

Dev-only mode (default): bootstrap only the dev environment.

```bash
cp terraform/bootstrap/dev/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/bootstrap/dev/terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your values
```

Required variables in `terraform/bootstrap/dev/terraform.tfvars`:
- `project` - GCP project ID for dev environment
- `region` - GCP Compute region (e.g., `us-central1`)
- `google_cloud_location` - Vertex AI model endpoint location (e.g., `global`)
- `agent_name` - Unique identifier (e.g., `my-agent`) — must match pre-bootstrap
- `terraform_state_bucket` - Bucket name from pre-bootstrap output (`terraform_state_buckets.dev`)
- `repository_owner` - GitHub username or organization
- `repository_name` - GitHub repository name

**Refer to `terraform.tfvars.example` for required variables you customized for your agent**

> [!NOTE]
> For production mode (dev → stage → prod), see [Infrastructure](infrastructure.md).

### 4. Bootstrap

```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform/bootstrap/dev init \
  -backend-config="bucket=$(terraform -chdir=terraform/bootstrap/pre output -json terraform_state_buckets | jq -r '.dev')"
terraform -chdir=terraform/bootstrap/dev apply
```

### 5. Verify

```bash
# Check GitHub Variables
gh variable list --env dev  # or GitHub repo Settings > Environments > dev
```

### 6. Set Up Claude PR Review

Opening a pull request triggers an automated Claude code review. It needs a one-time setup before the first PR: install the Claude GitHub App, then pick a model auth path, either Vertex AI in the dev project or a direct Anthropic credential. See [Claude PR Review](references/claude-pr-review.md).

See [Bootstrap Reference](references/bootstrap.md) for complete bootstrap setup instructions.

## Deploy

GitHub Actions deploy the agent resources:
- VPC network with Private Services Access for Cloud SQL private IP
- Cloud SQL instance for session persistence (`SESSION_SERVICE_URI`) with private IP only
- Bastion host running Auth Proxy for local developer access via IAP tunnel
- Agent Engine for memory persistence (`MEMORY_SERVICE_URI`)
- GCS bucket for artifact storage (`ARTIFACT_SERVICE_URI`)
- Cloud Run service with Auth Proxy sidecar and direct VPC egress
- Service account with least-privilege IAM bindings
- Additional cloud resources you customized for your agent

### 1. Create Pull Request

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/initial-setup

# Commit any initial customizations
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial setup"

# Push branch
git push origin feat/initial-setup

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "feat: initial setup" --body "Initial agent deployment"
```

### 2. Review and Merge

1. Review the Terraform plan in the PR comments
2. Verify the planned infrastructure changes
3. Merge the PR (triggers deployment to dev environment)

### 3. Monitor Deployment

```bash
# View workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --limit 5

# Watch logs (use run ID from list)
gh run view <run-id> --log

# Or: view in browser
gh run view <run-id> --web
```

Deployment flow:
1. Build Docker image
2. Run Terraform plan (infrastructure changes)
3. Deploy to Cloud Run (default environment)
4. Report outputs in job summary

### 4. Get Deployment Info

```bash
# View job summary (includes Cloud Run URL, resource URIs)
gh run view <run-id>
```

Save cloud resource values from the job summary to use in the next step.

## Run the Agent

Configure your local `.env` with cloud resource values from the deployment, then run the agent.

### 1. Create .env File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Add Cloud Resource Values

Add the values from the deployment job summary to `.env`:

```bash
BASTION_INSTANCE=agent-name-dev-bastion
BASTION_ZONE=us-central1-b
SESSION_SERVICE_URI=postgresql+asyncpg://YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT@project.iam:@localhost:5432/agent_sessions
MEMORY_SERVICE_URI=agentengine://projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/YOUR_LOCATION/reasoningEngines/YOUR_ENGINE_ID
ARTIFACT_SERVICE_URI=gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
# Add values for resources you customized for your agent
```

Set `TELEMETRY_NAMESPACE` to a unique value (e.g., your name) so teammates can filter to your traces in Cloud Trace.

Enable the development web interface in your `.env`:

```bash
SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE=TRUE
```

See [Environment Variables: Cloud Resources](environment-variables.md#cloud-resources) for where to find each value and a complete configuration reference.

### 3. Run the Local Agent

```bash
# Authenticate with GCP (if not already done)
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Standard development** (Docker Compose mirrors production, connects to cloud resources by reading `.env` values):

```bash
docker compose up --build --watch
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Docker Compose requires `roles/iap.tunnelResourceAccessor` on your Google account for the IAP tunnel to the bastion host. Grant via GCP Console (IAM) or `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding`.

**Local-only** (no cloud resource dependency):

> [!NOTE]
> `uv run server` reads `.env` and attempts to connect to cloud resources with the URIs configured above. To run fully local (SQLite sessions, in-memory storage), comment out `SESSION_SERVICE_URI`, `MEMORY_SERVICE_URI`, and `ARTIFACT_SERVICE_URI` from `.env`.

```bash
uv run server
```

Both modes export traces and structured logs to Cloud Trace and Cloud Logging automatically.

See [Development](development.md) for the full local development workflow including testing and code quality.

### 4. Run the Remote Agent

Authenticate to the deployed agent service using the Cloud Run proxy.

```bash
# Service name format: ${AGENT_NAME}-${environment} (e.g., your-agent-dev)
gcloud run services proxy <service-name> --project <project-id> --region <region> --port 8000

# In another terminal, test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected response: {"status": "ok"}

# Stop proxy: Ctrl+C
```

> [!TIP]
> ### Enable the deployed remote agent web interface (optional)
>
> To access the same dev UI available locally, set `SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE=TRUE` in the `dev` GitHub Environment variables and re-deploy:
>
> ```bash
> gh variable set SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE --env dev --body "TRUE"  # Or change in GitHub on the web
> ```
>
> Then re-run the latest CI/CD workflow (Actions tab → CI/CD Pipeline → Re-run jobs).
>
> Once deployed, the web UI is available at `http://localhost:8000` via the proxy.

See [Cloud Run proxy documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/developers#proxy) for details.
