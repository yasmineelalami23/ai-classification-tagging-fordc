# OpenTelemetry Architecture

ADK coexistence strategy, instrumentation decisions, and dependency management for the custom observability module.

## ADK Coexistence Strategy

The custom OpenTelemetry setup in `observability.py` must coexist with ADK's internal telemetry infrastructure. ADK creates its own `TracerProvider` (with in-memory exporters for the web UI) during `get_fast_api_app()`. The project augments this provider rather than replacing it.

### Two-Phase Initialization

The initialization is split across two functions called at specific points in `server.py`:

**Phase 1 — `configure_otel_resource()` (before ADK starts):**

```python
# server.py — module-level (runs at import time)
configure_otel_resource(agent_name=env.agent_name, project_id=env.google_cloud_project)
app = get_fast_api_app(...)  # ADK creates TracerProvider, reads OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES
```

This function builds and sets the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable with service identity attributes (`service.name`, `service.namespace`, `service.version`, `service.instance.id`, `gcp.project_id`). It must run *before* `get_fast_api_app()` because ADK's `TracerProvider` constructor reads `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` to build its `Resource` object. Setting attributes after construction has no effect.

**Phase 2 — `setup_opentelemetry()` (after ADK starts):**

```python
# server.py — main() function (runs at server start)
setup_opentelemetry(project_id=..., agent_name=..., log_level=...)
```

This function adds Cloud Trace and Cloud Logging exporters. For tracing, it detects ADK's existing `TracerProvider` via an `isinstance` check and adds a `BatchSpanProcessor` with an `OTLPSpanExporter` to it — preserving ADK's in-memory spans for the web UI while adding Google Cloud export. If no `TracerProvider` exists (theoretical deployment-only case), it creates one.

### Why Environment Variables Instead of Programmatic Resource Objects

OpenTelemetry's Python SDK allows creating `Resource` objects programmatically and passing them to `TracerProvider()`. However, this project uses the `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` environment variable instead because:

- ADK creates its own `TracerProvider` internally — the project has no control over that constructor call
- `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` is the standard mechanism for influencing any provider's resource configuration before it is constructed
- Both ADK's provider and any provider the project creates pick up the same attributes automatically

### ADK Auto-Instrumentation

ADK's `_setup_instrumentation_lib_if_installed()` (in `adk_web_server.py`) auto-detects `opentelemetry-instrumentation-google-genai` at startup. When the package is importable, ADK calls `GoogleGenAiSdkInstrumentor().instrument()` to monkey-patch `google.genai.Models.generate_content` and related methods.

The explicit `GoogleGenAiSdkInstrumentor().instrument()` call in `observability.py` is therefore redundant. It is kept as a defensive measure — if the project ever stops using `get_fast_api_app()`, the instrumentor would still be applied. The call is idempotent: OTel's `BaseInstrumentor` tracks instrumentation state and skips re-instrumentation.

### ADK Span Hierarchy

ADK produces its own span hierarchy using the `gcp.vertex.agent` tracer:

| Span Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `invocation` | Top-level span for a runner invocation |
| `invoke_agent {name}` | Agent-level span with agent name, session ID |
| `call_llm` | Wraps the LLM call |
| `generate_content {model}` | Model inference (delegated to genai instrumentor when installed) |
| `execute_tool {name}` | Individual tool execution |

When `opentelemetry-instrumentation-google-genai` is installed, ADK delegates `generate_content` span creation to the instrumentor and attaches extra attributes (agent name, conversation ID, user ID) via a context key mechanism. Without the instrumentor, ADK creates the span itself.

## Instrumentation Strategy

### Why `google-genai` Over `vertexai` Instrumentation

Two OpenTelemetry instrumentor packages exist for Google's generative AI SDKs:

| Package | Instruments | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `opentelemetry-instrumentation-google-genai` | `google.genai` SDK (`google.genai.Client`) | Active, recommended |
| `opentelemetry-instrumentation-vertexai` | Legacy `vertexai.generative_models` SDK | Active, but instruments a deprecated SDK |

ADK uses the `google-genai` SDK internally (via the `Gemini` model wrapper). The legacy `vertexai.generative_models` API is deprecated (June 2025) with removal planned for June 2026. `opentelemetry-instrumentation-vertexai` provides no value for ADK-based projects.

### Direct Dependency vs. ADK Extra

ADK's `[otel-gcp]` extra includes `opentelemetry-instrumentation-google-genai>=0.6b0`. This project installs it as a direct dependency instead, for explicit version control in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. Both approaches produce the same runtime behavior.

### What ADK Instruments Automatically

ADK's built-in tracing covers the agent orchestration layer:

- `invocation` → `call_llm` → `generate_content` / `execute_tool` spans
- Agent name, session ID, model, token usage, tool args/responses as span attributes
- Gen AI semantic convention attributes (`gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.request.model`, etc.)

ADK does **not** instrument HTTP routes. There are no `GET /health`, `POST /run`, or similar spans. Projects that expose custom HTTP routes and want HTTP-layer spans can opt in — see [HTTP Layer Instrumentation (FastAPI)](#http-layer-instrumentation-fastapi) below.

## Dependency Management

### Direct Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` | OTLP trace export to Cloud Trace. No cross-constraint with genai instrumentation (they share only `opentelemetry-api`) |
| `opentelemetry-exporter-gcp-logging` | Cloud Logging export via `CloudLoggingExporter` |
| `opentelemetry-instrumentation-logging` | Bridges Python `logging` module to OTel (injects trace context into `LogRecord` attributes) |
| `opentelemetry-instrumentation-google-genai` | Genai SDK instrumentation. ADK's `[otel-gcp]` extra includes this, but the project maintains explicit version control |
| `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi` | Opt-in HTTP-layer instrumentation. Imported unconditionally; activation gated on `setup_opentelemetry(..., app=app)`. Pulls in `opentelemetry-instrumentation-asgi` + `opentelemetry-util-http` + `asgiref` transitively |

### Transitive Dependencies (via ADK)

ADK pulls in a set of OpenTelemetry packages through its core and optional dependencies:

- `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-sdk` — Core API and SDK
- `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions` — Standard attribute names
- `opentelemetry-proto` — Protocol buffer definitions
- `opentelemetry-exporter-gcp-monitoring` — Cloud Monitoring export
- `opentelemetry-exporter-gcp-trace` — Cloud Trace export (GCP-native, not OTLP)
- `opentelemetry-resourcedetector-gcp` — Auto-detect GCP resource attributes

The project uses OTLP export (`opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc`) rather than GCP-native export (`opentelemetry-exporter-gcp-trace`) because OTLP is the vendor-neutral standard and supports the Cloud Trace v2 API endpoint directly.

## Background Task Context Propagation

FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` (via Starlette) does not propagate Python's `contextvars` across the async boundary. Any OpenTelemetry spans started in a background task are orphaned from the parent trace unless the OTel context is manually forwarded.

**Pattern:**

```python
from opentelemetry import context as otel_context

# In the request handler — capture context before scheduling
current_ctx = otel_context.get_current()
background_tasks.add_task(my_background_fn, ..., parent_otel_context=current_ctx)

# In the background function — attach and detach in try/finally
async def my_background_fn(..., parent_otel_context=None):
    token = (
        otel_context.attach(parent_otel_context)
        if parent_otel_context is not None
        else None
    )
    try:
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_span"):
            ...  # spans are linked to the parent trace
    finally:
        if token is not None:
            otel_context.detach(token)
```

Both `attach()` and `detach()` execute inside the background task's own async `contextvars.Context`. Because the token is created and released in the same context, no `ValueError` is raised and no defensive suppression is needed. This invariant is load-bearing: any refactor that moves `otel_context.attach(...)` outside the background task (e.g., back into the sync request handler) will introduce the "Token was created in a different Context" class of error.

## HTTP Layer Instrumentation (FastAPI)

`opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi` is an optional, opt-in instrumentor that adds HTTP-layer spans as parents to ADK's `invocation` spans. Enable it by passing the FastAPI instance to `setup_opentelemetry(..., app=app)`; leave `app` as `None` to skip.

A typical enabled trace tree looks like:

```
POST /some-route                     (FastAPI server span)
├── POST /some-route http receive    (ASGI http.request event)
├── <your custom handler spans>
│   └── invocation                   (ADK)
│       └── invoke_agent {agent}
│           └── call_llm
│               └── generate_content {model}
├── POST /some-route http send       (ASGI http.response.start)
└── POST /some-route http send       (ASGI http.response.body)
```

**Why `instrument_app(app)` instead of the global `.instrument()`:**

`FastAPIInstrumentor` provides two APIs:

| API | Effect |
|---|---|
| `FastAPIInstrumentor().instrument()` | Patches `FastAPI.__init__` so any FastAPI app **constructed after this call** gets auto-instrumented |
| `FastAPIInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)` | Wraps middleware on the **existing** `app` instance |

In `server.py`, the FastAPI app is created at module import time via `get_fast_api_app()`, well before `setup_opentelemetry()` is called inside `main()`. The global `.instrument()` form only patches future constructors, so it would miss the already-constructed app entirely. `instrument_app(app)` wraps the live instance and works regardless of construction order.

**Two `http send` spans per request:**

The ASGI instrumentor (to which `FastAPIInstrumentor` delegates) creates one span per outbound ASGI message. HTTP responses always produce two messages: `http.response.start` (status + headers) and `http.response.body` (body frame). Each span is tagged with an `asgi.event.type` attribute carrying the message type verbatim, so the two spans are distinguishable in Cloud Trace by inspecting that attribute. This is normal ASGI behavior, not a duplication bug. Source: `opentelemetry/instrumentation/asgi/__init__.py` (the `send_span.set_attribute("asgi.event.type", message["type"])` path).
