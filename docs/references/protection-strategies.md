# Protection Strategies Reference

Branch, tag, and environment protection setup and rationale.

## Overview

Three protection layers ensure code quality and security:

1. **Branch Protection (main)** - Manual setup, requires PR approval and status checks
2. **Tag Protection (v*)** - Automated by bootstrap (production mode), prevents tag manipulation
3. **Environment Protection (prod-apply)** - Manual reviewers, approval gate for production

## Branch Protection (Manual Setup Required)

Main branch protection ensures code quality and prevents accidental commits to main.

### Prerequisites

- **Repository admin access** — only admins (or org owners) can configure branch protection rules.
- **Status check names must already exist before you can require them.** GitHub's required-status-check picker only offers check names it has seen at least once on the repository. If a workflow has never run, the check it produces won't appear as a selectable option. Three common paths:
  - *Existing repo:* the workflow is already on `main` and has run on prior pushes — the status check name is already in the picker.
  - *Fresh repo:* open a PR that adds `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Workflows triggered by `pull_request` events run from the PR head ref (not the target branch), so the workflow runs on the PR even before protection is configured. After the first run completes, the status check name appears in the picker. Configure protection, then merge the PR.
  - *Migrating an existing repo to a renamed required check (like the `Required Checks / required-status` → `CI / status` rename):* open a PR with the new/renamed workflow. After the first run on the PR, edit the protection rule to add the new check name and remove the old one before merging. Doing the swap on the PR (rather than after merge) avoids a window where the rule references a check that no longer exists.

### What to Configure

1. **Require pull request before merging:**
   - Require approvals: 1 (minimum)
   - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed: ✅

2. **Require status checks to pass:**
   - Require branches to be up to date: ✅
   - Status checks required:
     - `CI / status` (from `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

3. **Do not allow bypassing settings:**
   - Allow specific actors to bypass: Repository admins only

4. **Other settings:**
   - ❌ Require linear history (optional, not required)
   - ❌ Allow force pushes (keep disabled)
   - ❌ Allow deletions (keep disabled)

### How to Configure (GitHub UI)

1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Click **Add branch protection rule**
3. Enter branch name pattern: `main`
4. Configure protection settings:
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
     - Required approvals: `1`
     - ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
     - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - Search for and select: `CI / status`
   - ✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
     - Allow specific actors to bypass: Repository admins (optional)
   - ❌ Require linear history (optional)
   - ❌ Allow force pushes (disabled)
   - ❌ Allow deletions (disabled)
5. Click **Create** or **Save changes**

### Verify

**GitHub UI:**
1. Settings → Branches
2. Confirm `main` branch protection rule exists
3. Check rule shows: 1 required approval, required status checks, dismiss stale reviews

**CLI:**
```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection | jq '{
  pr_reviews: .required_pull_request_reviews.required_approving_review_count,
  dismiss_stale: .required_pull_request_reviews.dismiss_stale_reviews,
  status_checks: .required_status_checks.contexts
}'
```

### Why Manual?

Branch protection rules are repository-wide policy decisions that vary by team workflow. Terraform would override manual adjustments on every apply.

Different teams may want:
- Different approval counts (1 vs 2)
- Different required status checks
- Different bypass permissions
- CODEOWNERS enforcement

Bootstrap can't predict these preferences, so we make it a manual configuration step.

## Tag Protection (Automated)

Production tag protection is **automatically configured** by bootstrap in production mode.

### What Bootstrap Creates

Bootstrap (`terraform/bootstrap/prod/`) creates a `github_repository_ruleset` that protects `v*` tags:

**Protection rules:**
- Prevents: tag creation, update, deletion by non-admins
- Prevents: force pushes to tags
- Allows: Repository admins to bypass (for tag management)

**Ruleset configuration:**
- Name: "Production Release Tag Protection"
- Target: Tags matching `refs/tags/v*`
- Enforcement: Active

### Verify

**GitHub UI:**
1. Settings → Rules → Rulesets
2. Confirm ruleset exists: **Production Release Tag Protection**
3. Check details:
   - Enforcement: **Active**
   - Target: **Tags**
   - Patterns: `refs/tags/v*`

**CLI:**
```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/rulesets | jq '.[] | {name, enforcement, target}'
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "name": "Production Release Tag Protection",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "target": "tag"
}
```

### Why Automated?

Tag protection is environment-specific infrastructure:
- Production mode **requires** tag protection (tags trigger prod deployments)
- Dev-only mode **doesn't need** tag protection (tags just version dev deployments)

Bootstrap enforces this consistently based on deployment mode. No manual decision needed.

## Environment Protection (Manual Approval Setup Required)

The `prod-apply` GitHub Environment requires manual approval before production deployments.

### What Bootstrap Creates

**Automated by bootstrap (production mode):**
- GitHub Environment: `prod-apply`
- Environment variables scoped to `prod-apply`

**Bootstrap does NOT configure:**
- Required reviewers (manual setup required)
- Wait timer
- Deployment branch policy

### What You Must Configure Manually

**Required reviewers** - Users or teams who can approve production deployments.

**How to configure:**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environments** → **prod-apply**
2. Under **Deployment protection rules**:
   - ✅ Check **Required reviewers**
   - Click **Add reviewers** search box
   - Add individual users (e.g., tech leads, SREs) or teams (e.g., @org/platform-team)
   - **Optional:** Check **Prevent self-review** (requires different approver than workflow trigger)
   - **Optional:** Check **Wait timer** and set delay (e.g., 5 minutes before allowing approval)
   - **Optional:** Check **Allow administrators to bypass** (admin override for emergencies)
3. Click **Save protection rules**
4. Under **Deployment branches and tags**:
   - Click dropdown → Select **Selected branches and tags**
   - Add branch rule: `main` (only main branch can trigger prod deployments)
   - Add tag rule: `v*.*.*` or `v*` (version tags can trigger prod deployments)
5. Click **Save protection rules**

### Verify

**GitHub UI:**
1. Settings → Environments
2. Confirm `prod-apply` environment exists
3. Click on `prod-apply` to view details
4. Check **Deployment protection rules** shows:
   - Required reviewers configured
   - Wait timer (if enabled)
   - Self-review prevention (if enabled)
5. Check **Deployment branches and tags** shows:
   - Branch rule: `main`
   - Tag rule: `v*.*.*` or `v*`

**CLI:**
```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/environments/prod-apply | jq '{
  name: .name,
  protection_rules: .protection_rules
}'
```

Expected output shows non-empty `reviewers` array.

### Why Manual?

Reviewer selection is a **human security decision** that changes over time:

- Team composition changes (new hires, departures, role changes)
- Responsibility shifts (different teams own production approvals)
- Organization structure evolves

Bootstrap creates the environment, but your team decides who can approve production deployments. The bootstrap module explicitly ignores reviewer changes (`lifecycle.ignore_changes`) to prevent Terraform from overwriting your manual selections.

## How Approvals Work

### Production Deployment Flow

1. Repository Admin (allowed to bypass tag protection ruleset) pushes tag matching allowed pattern: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0" && git push origin v1.0.0`
2. GitHub Actions workflow starts (tag must match `v*.*.*` or `v*` pattern configured in environment)
3. Jobs run sequentially:
   - Resolve image digest from stage
   - Promote image to prod registry
   - Run Terraform plan for prod
4. **prod-apply job waits for approval** (requires `prod-apply` Environment configured reviewer from approved list)
5. Configured reviewer sees notification: "Review deployments waiting"
6. Reviewer checks:
   - Deployment logs and outputs
   - Plan changes
   - Staging environment validation
7. Reviewer approves or rejects
8. If approved: Terraform apply runs, deploys to production
9. If rejected: Workflow fails, no deployment

**Note:** If tag doesn't match allowed pattern or workflow triggered from non-main branch, deployment to `prod-apply` environment will be blocked by environment rules.

### Approving a Deployment

**GitHub UI:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on the waiting workflow run
3. Click **Review deployments** button
4. Select environment: `prod-apply`
5. Add comment (optional but recommended): "LGTM - staging validation passed"
6. Click **Approve and deploy** or **Reject**

**CLI:**
```bash
# View pending deployments
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml | grep "waiting"

# Approve deployment (requires GitHub UI, no CLI support for approval)
```

**Note:** GitHub CLI doesn't support approving deployments. Use the GitHub UI.
