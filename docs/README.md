# 🤖 Agent Foundation Documentation

**Opinionated, production-ready LLM Agent deployment with enterprise-grade infrastructure.**

This template provides a complete foundation for building and deploying LLM Agents to production. Get automated CI/CD, managed state persistence, custom observability, and proven cloud infrastructure out of the box.

Built for teams who need to move beyond prototypes and ship production AI agents with confidence.

## Key Features

- 🐳 **Optimized Docker builds** - Multi-stage builds with uv (~200MB images, 5-10s rebuilds)
- 🏗️ **Automated CI/CD** - GitHub Actions + Terraform with smart PR automation
- 🌎 **Multi-environment deployments** - Production-grade dev/stage/prod isolation
- 💾 **Database sessions** - Cloud SQL Postgres for durable conversation state
- 🔭 **Custom observability** - OpenTelemetry with full trace-log correlation
- 🏰 **Hardened Cloud SQL** - Private IP only, IAM database auth, enforced TLS and Auth Proxy
- 🔐 **Workload Identity Federation** - CI/CD authentication (no service account keys)
