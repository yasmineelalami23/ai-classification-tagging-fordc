"""Gate-fidelity eval runner for the template root agent.

Runs stock ``AgentEvaluator`` against the shipped eval set. The agent performs
real model inference; the ``App`` (and its plugins) is applied via the
App-aware eval patch (``agent_foundation._eval_app_aware_patch``), so these
runs score the same agent adk web chat and the deployed server run.

Two gates share the eval set:

- Deterministic (``test_config.json``, auto-discovered from the eval set's
  directory): exact tool-trajectory matching and ROUGE-1 response overlap, no
  LLM judge. This is the CI PR gate.
- Judge (``full_eval_config.json``, loaded explicitly): adds LLM-judge and
  safety metrics whose ``app_details`` context is populated in-process by the
  App-aware patch. This is the CI merge gate, run by ``judge-eval.yml``.

Both gates run the agent with live model inference, so both need real
credentials; the judge gate additionally calls the Gen AI evaluation service.

Both use ``AgentEvaluator``, which raises ``AssertionError`` on sub-threshold
metrics, so a pytest failure IS the gate. The ``adk eval`` CLI renders the same
eval set for interactive authoring but exits 0 even when cases fail, so it
cannot gate CI.

Preflight liveness tests make one minimal live call per model role before the gates run.
ADK silently drops inference-failed cases from scoring, so without them a totally
unreachable endpoint passes vacuously over an empty metric set (issue #229).
``test_liveness_agent_model`` probes the agent's inference model (both gates run
the agent); ``test_liveness_judge_model`` probes each autorater in the judge
config (``judge`` gate only). Each probe reads its role's own source of truth, so
changing a model re-points the matching probe automatically.

A failed probe arms ``session.shouldfail`` (the knob ``-x`` sets), so the lane
aborts before the paid ``AgentEvaluator`` tests run instead of grinding every
case against a dead endpoint. This keeps fail-fast in the module: ``maxfail`` via
``pytest_configure`` would need a ``conftest.py``, which this lane deliberately
omits. The liveness tests are defined before the eval tests so the abort lands
before any inference.

What a run scores is fixed in this module, not passed in: the file paths and run
counts below are plain constants. A consumer changing what is evaluated is already
editing ``tests/eval/data/``, so the values live one file away rather than behind
workflow inputs and environment variables.

Run with ``uv run pytest tests/eval`` (real credentials and LLM cost). It lives
under ``tests/eval/`` and exercises the live model.

# than counting it as a miss. The deterministic gate keeps 2 because exact trajectory
