"""Post-deploy smoke checks against a live Cloud Run revision.

This lane confirms a freshly deployed revision actually serves: it drives the live
service URL over a real network with an authenticated httpx client, so a request
crosses the network, the Auth Proxy sidecar, and Cloud SQL exactly as production
traffic does.

Checks are layered cheapest-first, each a distinct failure class so a failure localizes
the broken subsystem:

- L0 liveness: the revision serves HTTP at all (``/health`` -> 200).
- L1 session create: Cloud SQL is reachable via the Auth Proxy sidecar (a session row
  persists). Deterministic, no model. Provided as a module-scoped fixture so its
  teardown deletes the row unconditionally even if a later check fails.
- L2 thin agent turn: the run path streams a model response (``/run_sse``). The real
  model is invoked, but the assertion is presence-only — at least one event carries a
  text part — never content, so there is no LLM-judge dependency.
- L3 cleanup: the smoke session is deleted and a follow-up GET returns 404, proving the
  delete path and leaving no residue.

The service is private (``--no-allow-unauthenticated``), so Cloud Run requires a
Google-signed OIDC ID token whose audience is the service URL. The caller's own
Application Default Credentials — the developer's gcloud login locally, the GitHub
Actions WIF principal in CI — cannot mint that token directly, so the client
impersonates a dedicated invoker service account (``SMOKE_INVOKER_SA``) to generate the
ID token in-process and sends it as ``Authorization: Bearer``. The lane runs only by
explicit path (``uv run pytest tests/smoke``) against ``SMOKE_BASE_URL``.
