"""Integration tests: real FastAPI app against real Postgres, no mocks, no LLM.

Validates that the wired components (ADK ``get_fast_api_app()``,
``DatabaseSessionService``, asyncpg, session persistence) work together against the
Postgres dialect, not just sqlite. The session service is never mocked; the only
substitution is a deterministic stubbed model on the run path (``MockLlm`` below).

This lane builds the production FastAPI app via ADK ``get_fast_api_app()`` against a
real ``postgresql+asyncpg://`` session service and drives it in-process with httpx
``ASGITransport``. Only the LLM is replaced (``root_agent.model`` -> ``MockLlm``) so the
run path persists and reads session state without a network call or cost.

Every test carries two module-level marks (``pytestmark``): ``integration`` (the lane
runs only by explicit path, ``uv run pytest tests/integration``) and
``asyncio(loop_scope="session")``. The session loop scope is required because the
``integration_app`` and ``client`` fixtures are session-scoped (one connection pool per
run): their async setup and these tests must share one event loop, or the pool's asyncpg
connections get created on a loop that's closed before engine disposal.

Postgres is provided by a throwaway ``testcontainers`` container started once per run
(the ``database_uri`` fixture below), so ``uv run pytest tests/integration`` needs only
a running Docker daemon — no manual container setup, in CI or locally. Set
``INTEGRATION_DATABASE_URI`` to point the lane at an already-running Postgres instead
(see ``docs/references/integration-tests.md``).

The lane needs no GCP credentials. The ``_mock_gcp_credentials`` autouse session
fixture below blocks real ADC and ``.env`` lookups. A fixture suffices because this
module imports the source package lazily — inside ``integration_app``, not at
collection — so the patch is in place before any agent code runs.

    closes runners but never disposes the session engine, and httpx ``ASGITransport``
    never emits ASGI lifespan events in any case. Session-scoped so one pool is built
    and disposed per run rather than one per test.
